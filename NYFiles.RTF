\f2\fs20 \cf0 Dr. Rosenbluth, who received her physics Ph.D. at 21, helped create an algorithm that has become a foundation of understanding huge quantities of data. She died of complications of the coronavirus.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The Metropolis algorithm, a technique for generating random samplings, started out as a way to understand a fundamental problem: how atoms rearrange themselves as solids melt.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Over the decades, the Metropolis algorithm and its subsequent variations have been put to a vast number of uses and now serve as an underpinning to understanding critical challenges of our age, including making sense of huge volumes of data, predicting election outcomes and understanding Covid-19\'92s spread.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 A physicist who played an important role in developing that algorithm and thus shaping the science of simulation, Arianna Wright Rosenbluth, died on Dec. 28 at a nursing home in Pasadena, Calif. She was 93. The cause was complications of Covid-19, her daughter Jean Rosenbluth said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Despite her extraordinary work and despite earning her Ph.D. from Harvard at 21, Dr. Rosenbluth left the field in her mid-20s and rarely talked about her scientific achievement afterward.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 James Gubernatis, a physicist now retired from Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, said he called Dr. Rosenbluth in 2003 and asked for her recollections of the Metropolis algorithm\'92s development. \'93She really just wasn\'92t aware of the impact it\'92s had,\'94 he said. \'93It was like, \'91Oh, that thing.\'92 She was surprised that anyone even remembered it.\'94
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The Metropolis algorithm, which Dr. Rosenbluth programmed, is the basis of what today are called Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, a mathematics of probability and statistics that provide simulations for complex problems that don\'92t have convenient solutions. These methods have been used in millions of applications, spreading well beyond physics to chemistry, biology and social science. Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods are applied to economic and

\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Covid-19\'92s spread

\f2\fs20 \cf0 \'93It has earned a permanent place among the most important computer algorithms of all time,\'94 said Adam Iaizzi, a physicist who dedicated his 2018 doctoral dissertation to Dr. Rosenbluth. \'93Almost 70 years later, it is still taught in every beginning computational physics course.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Arianna Wright was born on Sept. 15, 1927, in Houston to Augustus and Leffie (Woods) Wright. Her mother was a schoolteacher, and her father was an office manager for a flower company.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Dr. Rosenbluth, an only child, was shy as a girl and a bookworm with a lifelong fascination with L. Frank Baum\'92s Oz series, her daughter said. She attended Rice Institute (now Rice University) in Houston on a full scholarship and received her bachelor\'92s degree in physics in 1946. She was 18.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Dr. Rosenbluth was an accomplished fencer, winning not only women\'92s championships but also men\'92s. But her plans to compete in the Olympics were foiled, first by the cancellation of the 1944 summer Games during World War II, then by a lack of funds for travel to the London Games in 1948, her daughter said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 She received her master\'92s degree in physics from Radcliffe College in 1947 and immediately began doctoral studies at Harvard.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 At the time, female physicists were exceedingly rare, and not always welcomed into the fold. Her son, Alan, also a physicist, said that when his mother had set out to find a dissertation adviser, she originally approached the physicist Felix Bloch.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93He told her flat out, without malice, but just as a fact, that he wouldn\'92t take female Ph.D. students,\'94 Dr. Rosenbluth said.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 She eventually did her doctoral research under the supervision of 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 John Hasbrouck Van Vleck.
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  She received her Ph.D. in 1949, making her the fifth woman to earn a physics Ph.D. from Harvard since it began awarding them in 1873.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 After completing her dissertation, she traveled west for a postdoctoral fellowship at Stanford University, funded by the Atomic Energy Commission. There she met Marshall Rosenbluth, another physicist.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 They married in 1951 and moved to New Mexico to work at Los Alamos. One colleague was Edward Teller, the famously fierce advocate of the hydrogen, or thermonuclear, bomb.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Dr. Rosenbluth honed her computing skills when she verified analytic calculations for the first full-scale test of a thermonuclear bomb, in 1952, code-named Ivy Mike. Separately, she and her husband then collaborated with Dr. Teller, his wife, the mathematician Augusta Teller, and the mathematical physicist Nicholas Metropolis to use random sampling to simulate a specific phenomenon in physics: the rearrangement of atoms when a solid melts.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The work resulted in the Metropolis algorithm. The group published its seminal paper, \'93Equation of State Calculations by Fast Computing Machines,\'94 in The Journal of Chemical Physics in 1953.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Marshall Rosenbluth 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 told an interviewer in 2003
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  that the group had discovered an entirely new approach to doing physics, thanks in large part to the advent of computers.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Arianna Rosenbluth\'92s contribution was crucial. \'93She actually did all the coding, which at that time was a new art for these new machines,\'94 Marshall Rosenbluth said in 2003. Sophisticated programming tools were still years away, so Dr. Rosenbluth programmed in machine language, the strings of 1\'92s and 0\'92s a computer understands.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In 1956, the Rosenbluths moved to San Diego, where Marshall Rosenbluth took a job at General Atomics, a division of General Dynamics that had been established to explore peaceful uses of atomic energy. Their marriage ended in divorce in 1978.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In addition to her daughter Jean and her son, Alan, Dr. Rosenbluth\'92s survivors include two other daughters, Robin and Mary; five grandchildren; a step-grandchild; and two great-grandchildren.

\f2\fs20 After Los Alamos, Arianna Rosenbluth did not work professionally again, focusing instead on raising her children.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93This was someone at the start of an extraordinary career, really punching above anyone\'92s weight at the time,\'94 said Benjamin Pope, a computational astrophysicist and lecturer at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 \'93So she makes a serious contribution to statistical physics and then she\'92s never heard from again,\'94 said Dr. Pope, who created a 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Wikipedia page
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  about Dr. Rosenbluth. \'93And today you couldn\'92t throw a rock down the street in Palo Alto or Berkeley without finding someone who\'92s running MCMC,\'94 he added, referring to the technology-rich cities in California.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Still, Dr. Rosenbluth maintained her love of science.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93All while I was growing up, I remember her constantly working out equations just for her own mental exercise,\'94 her daughter Jean, a federal magistrate judge in Los Angeles, said. Alan Rosenbluth said his mother had pursued independent research in knot theory, a branch of mathematics.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Andrew Gelman, a statistician and political scientist at Columbia University, pointed out that many applications today use a program called Stan, which is based on a variant of the Metropolis algorithm. Dr. Gelman and his colleagues named the program after Stanislaw Ulam, a co-creator of the Monte Carlo methods.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93Maybe we should\'92ve called it Arianna,\'94 he said.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Artificial intelligence used to evaluate job candidates must not become a tool that exacerbates discrimination.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 American democracy depends on everyone having equal access to work. But in reality, people of color, women, those with disabilities and other marginalized groups experience unemployment or underemployment at disproportionately high rates, especially amid the economic fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic. Now the use of artificial intelligence technology for hiring may exacerbate those problems and further bake bias into the hiring process. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   At the moment, the New York City Council is debating a proposed new law that would regulate automated tools used to evaluate job candidates and employees. If done right, the law could make a real difference in the city and have wide influence nationally: In the absence of federal regulation, states and cities have used models from other localities to regulate emerging technologies.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Over the past few years, an increasing number of employers have started using artificial intelligence and other automated tools to speed up hiring, save money and screen job applicants without in-person interaction. These are all features that are increasingly attractive during the pandemic. These technologies include screeners that scan r\'e9sum\'e9s for key words, games that claim to assess attributes such as generosity and appetite for risk, and even emotion analyzers that claim to read facial and vocal cues to predict if candidates will be engaged and team players.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   In most cases, vendors train these tools to analyze workers who are deemed successful by their employer and to measure whether job applicants have similar traits. This approach can worsen underrepresentation and social divides if, for example, Latino men or Black women are inadequately represented in the pool of employees. In another case, a r\'e9sum\'e9-screening tool could identify Ivy League schools on successful employees' r\'e9sum\'e9s and then downgrade r\'e9sum\'e9s from historically Black or women's colleges.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   In its current form, the council's bill would require vendors that sell automated assessment tools to audit them for bias and discrimination, checking whether, for example, a tool selects male candidates at a higher rate than female candidates. It would also require vendors to tell job applicants the characteristics the test claims to measure. This approach could be helpful: It would shed light on how job applicants are screened and force vendors to think critically about potential discriminatory effects. But for the law to have teeth, we recommend several important additional protections.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The measure must require companies to publicly disclose what they find when they audit their tech for bias. Despite pressure to limit its scope, the City Council must ensure that the bill would address discrimination in all forms -- on the basis of not only race or gender but also disability, sexual orientation and other protected characteristics.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   These audits should consider the circumstances of people who are multiply marginalized -- for example, Black women, who may be discriminated against because they are both Black and women. Bias audits conducted by companies typically don't do this.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The bill should also require validity testing, to ensure that the tools actually measure what they claim to, and it must make certain that they measure characteristics that are relevant for the job. Such testing would interrogate whether, for example, candidates' efforts to blow up a balloon in an online game really indicate their appetite for risk in the real world -- and whether risk-taking is necessary for the job. Mandatory validity testing would also eliminate bad actors whose hiring tools do arbitrary things like assess job applicants' personalities differently based on subtle changes in the background of their video interviews.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   In addition, the City Council must require vendors to tell candidates how they will be screened by an automated tool before the screening, so candidates know what to expect. People who are blind, for example, may not suspect that their video interview could score poorly if they fail to make eye contact with the camera. If they know what is being tested, they can engage with the employer to seek a fairer test. The proposed legislation currently before the City Council would require companies to alert candidates within 30 days if they have been evaluated using A.I., but only after they have taken the test.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Finally, the bill must cover not only the sale of automated hiring tools in New York City but also their use. Without that stipulation, hiring-tool vendors could escape the obligations of this bill by simply locating sales outside the city. The council should close this loophole.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   With this bill, the city has the chance to combat new forms of employment discrimination and get closer to the ideal of what America stands for: making access to opportunity more equitable for all. Unemployed New Yorkers are watching.

\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone : \'93Governments are putting exhausted populations under lockdown. Street protests are turning violent. A year after the virus began spreading in Europe, things feel unnervingly the same.\'94\
As 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Eyck Freymann and Elettra Ardissino
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  write in Foreign Policy: \'93Spring in the European Union is going to be dismal.\'94 Bild, a German newspaper, 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 recently ran the headline
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  \'93Liebe Briten, We Beneiden You!\'94 \'97 a mixture of German and English that means \'93Dear Brits, We Envy You!\'94 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Wolfgang M\'fcnchau
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  of Eurointelligence has said that Europe\'92s vaccination program rivals the continent\'92s budget austerity of recent years as \'93the E.U.\'92s worst policy error during my lifetime.\'94\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Why has Europe done so poorly? There are three main reasons.\
1. Too much bureaucracy\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 While the U.S. and other countries rushed to sign agreements with vaccine makers, the E.U. first tried to make sure all 27 of its member countries agreed on how to approach the negotiations. Europe chose \'93to prioritize process over speed and to put solidarity between E.U. countries ahead of giving individual governments more room to maneuver,\'94 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Jillian Deutsch and Sarah Wheaton
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  write for Politico Europe.\
The result was slower regulatory approval of the vaccines and delayed agreements to buy doses, 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 forcing Europe to wait in line
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  behind countries that moved faster.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 2. Penny-wise and pound-foolish\
Europe put a big emphasis on negotiating a low price for vaccine doses. Israeli officials, by contrast, were willing to pay a premium to receive doses quickly. Israel has paid around $25 per Pfizer dose, and the U.S. pays about $20 per dose. The E.U. pays from $15 to $19.\
The discounted price became another reason that Europe had to wait in line behind other countries. Even in purely economic terms, the trade-off will probably be a bad one: Each $1 saved per vaccine dose might ultimately add up to $1 billion \'97 a rounding error in a trading bloc with a nearly $20 trillion annual economic output. A single additional lockdown, like the one Italy announced this week, could wipe out any savings.\
\'93The price difference is macroeconomically irrelevant,\'94 M\'fcnchau writes. The E.U. \'93tried to lock in a perceived short-term price advantage at the expense of everything else.\'94\
3. Vaccine skepticism\
\'93Europe is the world\'92s epicenter of vaccine skepticism,\'94 Deutsch and Wheaton of Politico Europe write. That skepticism predated Covid, and now its consequences are becoming clear.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 In 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 a survey published in the journal Nature Medicine
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , residents of 19 countries were asked if they would take a Covid vaccine that had been \'93proven safe and effective.\'94 In China, 89 percent of people said yes. In the U.S., 75 percent did. The shares were lower across most of Europe: 68 percent in Germany, 65 percent in Sweden, 59 percent in France and 56 percent in Poland.\
The skepticism helps explain Europe\'92s latest vaccination problem. About a dozen countries, including France and Germany, have 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 suspended the use of one of the continent\'92s primary vaccines
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , from AstraZeneca, citing concerns about blood clots.\
But the evidence that the vaccine causes clots 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 is thin
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone . Europe\'92s main drug regulator still says the benefits outweigh the risks. And Ann Taylor, AstraZeneca\'92s chief medical officer, has pointed out that the rate of clotting among vaccinated Europeans is lower than \'93would be expected among the general population.\'94\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Dr. Muge Cevik, a virus expert at the University of St. Andrews, told me yesterday that it was always important to scrutinize vaccines. But, she added, \'93I would say the benefits of the A.Z. vaccine in preventing Covid, hospitalization and death outweigh the risks of side effects, especially in the middle of the pandemic.\'94\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 The bottom line: Over the summer, the U.S. was 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 struggling more than any other country
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  to contain Covid. Today, Europe appears to be in much worse shape.\

\f2\fs20 \cf0 As U.S. coronavirus cases remain at a low not seen since October, a more contagious variant first reported in the United Kingdom has likely grown to account for more than 20 percent of new U.S. cases as of this week, according to an analysis of data from Helix, a lab testing company.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 There is not yet enough genomic sequencing -- the process required to screen positive coronavirus samples for variants -- to be certain of how widely that variant, known as B.1.1.7, is spreading. But data suggests its share of total cases is growing at a trajectory similar to that seen in countries where it has fueled surges. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Still, experts note that low total case counts in states with a high share of B.1.1.7 are an encouraging sign. It remains to be seen, they say, whether the variant will cause a significant resurgence here or whether widespread vaccinations and virus-control measures can keep case counts at bay.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The B.1.1.7 variant is just one variant of concern found in the United States, in addition to a variant first identified in Brazil and another discovered in South Africa. But those variants make up a tiny fraction of total cases compared with B.1.1.7, which experts say is likely to become dominant across the country this month. The variant is doubling as a share of all new U.S. cases approximately every 10 days, continuing a pattern first identified by researchers in early February.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Screening for variants requires sending a positive sample to a lab to be sequenced, which takes time and resources. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it often takes about 10 days to sequence a sample and analyze it for reporting. Estimates for the cost of sequencing a sample range from $25 to $400, according to a report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. And the large amount of data each sequence generates requires computational and 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  expertise that many health departments struggle to afford.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Only 0.5 percent of cumulative cases in the country have been sequenced since the beginning of the pandemic, but, with new efforts, about 1 percent of new cases in February and about 3 percent in the past two weeks were sequenced, according to C.D.C. data and Jasmine Reed, a spokeswoman for the agency.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Experts' recommendations on how many cases should be sequenced vary, but many say sequencing around 5 percent of cases would begin to adequately show the spread of variants circulating at low levels.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The United Kingdom, by contrast, has sequenced about 8 percent of its total cases and is currently doing so for about a third of its cases, according to its health secretary. It has about as many new cases per day as Florida. Denmark, another world leader in coronavirus genomic surveillance, had sequenced about 12 percent of its total cases as of January. It now sequences almost all new positive cases, which are now at daily levels comparable to Mississippi or Missouri.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The share of cumulative cases sequenced varies widely by state, from as high as 3.5 percent in Hawaii to 0.05 percent in Tennessee. Some states have had an advantage: It's easier to sequence a higher share of cases if the total number of cases is lower. But those vast differences in genomic surveillance mean it is especially difficult to estimate how widely a given variant is spreading in states where there are not many cases being monitored.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   According to estimates based on the Helix data, there were most likely tens of thousands of cases attributed to B.1.1.7 in the United States in the past week alone. But because sequencing is so low, only 2,672 cases have been officially recorded.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Helix has analyzed nearly half a million positive samples for an anomaly indicative of the B.1.1.7 variant. Helix then sent samples to Illumina, a gene-sequencing company, to have their genomes sequenced to confirm the variant. Based on results from those samples and the share of cases with the anomaly, Helix is able to make inferences about how widely B.1.1.7 might be spreading.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The relative share of the variant grew exponentially over the past several weeks in almost every state where Helix had enough data for a trend to be evident. In Florida, the share of cases caused by the B.1.1.7 variant was highest: well over an estimated 30 percent of cases. Nationwide, the figure is probably more than 20 percent, though Helix's testing is not representative of population distribution.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   But there could be some good news: Even Florida, where the variant is spreading most widely as a share of total cases, has not yet seen a resurgence in total new coronavirus cases.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''I am encouraged by the declining case counts in the most heavily affected states,'' said Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University. ''I've been watching Florida closely, which has the highest share of B.1.1.7. Case counts have plateaued there in recent days but are not resurging. The longer we can hold the line, the more time we have to roll out vaccines, which will protect individuals, particularly those at highest risk of severe illness, and slow transmission over all.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   B.1.1.7 is not the only variant of concern in the United States, but it has by far the biggest foothold. According to the C.D.C., which is tracking confirmed cases of the variants, there are more than 30 times as many cases of B.1.1.7 as of the other two variants of concern first reported in South Africa (called B.1.351) and Brazil (called P.1). So far, those other two have been found in a minority of states, but given the low rate of sequencing in many states, they are most likely spreading undetected in others.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''The other variants are circulating at very low levels now compared to B.1.1.7, but over the long run it will be important to watch those because they have the potential to make our vaccines less effective,'' Dr. Rivers said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Although total cases have been going down in recent weeks, B.1.1.7 cases have not, which means that it may not be surprising to see cases start rising again in regions that have high levels of B.1.1.7 transmission,'' said William Lee, vice president of science at Helix.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   But even if another resurgence in cases begins, Dr. Lee says it is reasonable to hope the situation would be different than when the United Kingdom faced a sharp spike around the holidays. ''I think even if cases start going up again, the impact on hospitalizations and mortality may still be mitigated by vaccinations and higher levels of natural immunity than we had in the past.''

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Louis Beryl insists that financially responsible young people are the borrowers most disadvantaged by the traditional math of consumer lending. The standard scoring of creditworthiness relies largely on a person's credit history, and that's a blunt instrument. Since young people have slender credit histories, he said, they pay higher rates than they should.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Mr. Beryl is betting that he and his team at Earnest, a San Francisco start-up, can do better. Earnest is one of a new breed of lenders bringing the tools of 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  - the modern flood of data and clever software - to consumer finance, which I wrote about in 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 an article last week
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone .  Their approach is a digital-age spin on the most basic principle of banking: Know your customer.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Earnest, founded in 2013, began lending last year with general consumer loans. They are typically for a few thousand dollars, though they can range up to $30,000. Many of the loans are for relocation expenses and  professional training. Most of Earnest's borrowers are college graduates, aged 22 to 34.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 So it is scarcely surprising that the next market for Earnest will be student debt, introducing on Tuesday a refinancing product for student loans. The start-up also announced on Tuesday that it closed a $17 million Series A round of venture investment, led by Maveron. To date, Earnest has raised $32 million including debt financing. Its venture capital investors include Maveron, Andreessen Horowitz and Atlas Venture.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Other 
\f0\i\b \ul data-science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  lenders plan to offer education loans. Affirm, another start-up in San Francisco, will soon start making loans for so-called accelerated learning programs, said Brad Selby, vice president of business development. These short, intensive courses are designed to teach skills like computer programming and 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  that improve a person's job prospects, and thus ability to repay a loan.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Interest rates on Earnest's student loan refinancing product can be as low as 1.92 percent, the company says. But another advantage is that Earnest's personalized underwriting allows for tailored rates and gives borrowers considerable flexibility. A borrower can to go the company's website and change the repayment rate and term of the loan, and the site instantly recalculates the borrower's total cost over the life of the loan.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 With more than $1 trillion in outstanding student loan debt in America, Earnest is certainly entering a large market, and making repayment cheaper and easier would have an economic and social payoff.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 "Student loans are our generation's first homes," said Mr. Beryl, the 34-year-old co-founder and chief executive of Earnest. And he still holds $100,000 in student debt himself, a legacy of attending pricey if prestigious schools - Princeton, the Harvard Business School and Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 All the new data-driven lenders tap many different sources of information, and they are all constantly experimenting with new combinations of data and fine-tuning their predictive software. The loan approval process can be completely automated or require a human nod at the end.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 For Earnest, the student loan refinancing product will rely on the system used for its consumer loans.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Earnest asks its borrowers for a lot of information. It wants to see their bank accounts, credit-card statements, student loan and any other loan balances. It also wants to see any investment accounts or retirement accounts. It asks loan candidates to make sure their LinkedIn accounts of job and education history are filled in and up to date.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This is all done without paperwork. Earnest expects its borrowers to conduct their financial lives online. Earnest says it has read-only access to the information. It pledges not to store personal data or sell it. Earnest's software algorithms give weight to things not factored into traditional credit analysis like education and savings, which, in the start-up's calculations, point to capacity to pay and lower risk.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20  "Our clients are giving us access to their data," Mr. Beryl said, "so we can dig into the details of their life."
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Autumn Carter, 26, borrowed $3,000 from Earnest in September, to furnish and decorate a new apartment in Mountain View, Calif. She wanted a loan quickly and conveniently, so she looked for alternatives to traditional banks or credit unions. Ms. Carter went online, searched and noticed a reference to Earnest and its "merit-based loans" with low interest rates. "At first, I thought it was a scam," she recalled.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20  But Ms. Carter proceeded to do some online research and saw favorable reviews, saying the loan process was smooth and the customer service helpful. She went to the Earnest website, and filled out the loan application in 10 minutes or so. The information she passed on included that she graduated from Stanford in 2011, and has under $10,000 in student loans outstanding; she was once rejected for a loan for lack of a credit history; and she makes a salary of about $55,000 as the executive director of California Common Sense, a public policy research group.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Ms. Carter's non-profit research organization focuses on data-driven policy analysis. She handed over her personal information without hesitation, and she finds Earnest's data-gathering and analysis for determining credit risk to be "fascinating."
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Within a day, Ms. Carter received an email approving her three-year loan with an annual interest rate of about 5 percent, a calculation based on her data. She plans to pay off the loan early, and there are no prepayment penalties on Earnest loans. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 At Earnest, smart software is its animating engine, but at this stage two or more people in the company review the predictive recommendations of the algorithms - and they make the final call. Fewer people may be needed as the software gets better. "But we think the human element," Mr. Beryl said, "will always be an important piece in our process to make sure we are getting it right."

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The exuberance surrounding big data has passed its peak and is trending down, Gartner declared last August in 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 its annual "hype cycle" report
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone on perceptions of technology.  
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Perhaps, but it remains a rising market for data scientists.  Salaries rose 8 percent on average in the last year, with bonuses adding $56,000, according to a salary and employment survey released on Tuesday by
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Burtch Works
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , a recruiter of professionals with quantitative skills. 
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The median base salary for entry-level data scientists was $91,000 nationally and $110,000 in Silicon Valley, the survey found. For experienced data scientists, leading teams of 10 or more, salaries are up to $250,000. The report was based on telephone interviews with 371 data scientists
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The survey also points to a shift in demand for data scientists. The share of workers with deep data skills who are employed by start-ups fell by more than half, from 29 percent last year to 14 percent this year. Linda Burtch, managing director of the recruiting firm that bears her name, said the change reflected how much companies in mainstream industries like retailing, consumer products, insurance, health care and manufacturing were building up 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  capabilities. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The appeal for data scientists, Ms. Burtch said, is "you get to work on really good problems, and these established companies can offer them a decent work-life balance."
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Khalid Ahmed, 25, is finishing up his Ph.D. at the University of Michigan. His field of computational physics and materials science, Mr. Ahmed said, has increasingly become a 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  - and he has veered in that direction. He was recruited by several companies including start-ups. One analyzed credit card data to target marketing and advertising campaigns. Instead, Mr. Ahmed chose to join Ford Motor as a data engineer in its hybrid car program.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 With start-ups, Mr. Ahmed explained, the work often involves producing data-derived knowledge that is then sold to a larger company. But at a large manufacturer like Ford, he said, "I'll be influencing the design of the product itself."
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In Charlotte, N.C., Ahmer Inam, 39, recently left Sonic Automotive, a large auto retailer with 100 dealerships in 14 states, where he was director of predictive analytics. He enjoyed the work, but ultimately he decided he wanted to move beyond tailored marketing. "Our work was designed to seduce a customer toward a particular vehicle and determine the optimal price," he said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 When he decided to leave, Mr. Inam had several offers from traditional companies and start-ups, and he chose the consulting firm  PricewaterhouseCoopers, which he joined last month. Mr. Inam was attracted by the prospect of working in a variety of industries and the opportunity to prod organizations to adopt the tools and methods of 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone . The consulting firm, he said, also encourages its  professionals to use their skills on nonprofit community projects. At PricewaterhouseCoopers, Mr. Inam said, "I can have a work-life balance that allows me to engage in analytics for social good initiatives."
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 There is an apparent contradiction between the buoyant job market for big data practitioners and Gartner's judgment that, on the perception scale, big data has moved  from high expectations to what Gartner calls the "trough of disillusionment." But, in fact, it fits a familiar pattern of technology absorption and use. Significant new technologies always take time to move into the mainstream as people and organizations learn to exploit them. It takes years. 
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 classic study
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  of the phenomenon, "The Dynamo and the Computer: An Historical Perspective on the Modern Productivity Paradox," by Paul David, an economic historian at Stanford University, was published in 1990. In it, Mr. David noted, the electric motor was introduced in the early 1880s, but its real payoff in productivity was not evident until the 1920s. It took that long for businesses to reorganize work around the industrial production line, the efficiency breakthrough of its day, made possible by the electric motor. 
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Similarly, it took a while for personal computers and the Internet to deliver big gains. And so too for big data, which harnesses computing, modern digital data and the software tools of artificial intelligence.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 A report this week from Forrester Research described the challenge ahead. "Businesses are drowning in data but starving for insights," the report began. "Worse, they have no systematic way to turn data into action."
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The Gartner hype cycle acknowledges that enthusiasm precedes  mainstream money-making. The graphic representation of the cycle looks like an exaggerated, lazy wave. After the disillusion phase comes the "slope of enlightenment" and then the "plateau of productivity." As Merv Adrian, an analyst at Gartner, put it, "If you want to see the revenue side of the hype cycle, you basically just flip it."

In it, Mr. David noted, the electric motor was introduced in the early 1880s, but its real payoff in productivity was not evident until the 1920s. It took that long for businesses to reorganize work around the industrial production line, the efficiency breakthrough of its day, made possible by the electric motor.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Similarly, it took a while for personal computers and the Internet to deliver big gains. And so too for big data, which harnesses computing, modern digital data and the software tools of artificial intelligence.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   A report this week from Forrester Research described the challenge ahead. ''Businesses are drowning in data but starving for insights,'' the report began. ''Worse, they have no systematic way to turn data into action.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The Gartner hype cycle acknowledges that enthusiasm precedes mainstream moneymaking. The graphic representation of the cycle looks like an exaggerated, lazy wave. After the disillusion phase comes the ''slope of enlightenment'' and then the ''plateau of productivity.'' As Merv Adrian, an analyst at Gartner, put it, ''If you want to see the revenue side of the hype cycle, you basically just flip it.''

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Association for Computing Machinery
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , a leading professional association in computer science, is holding its annual conference this week, focusing on what we're now calling 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  - though the ACM still clings to the label adopted when the yearly gatherings began in 1998,       \'a0    
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone . Of course, the field is booming, so the four-day conclave of talks, technical papers and human networking in New York has attracted an estimated 2,200 attendees, double last year's headcount. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 But in his keynote speech on Monday, Oren Etzioni, a prominent computer scientist and chief executive of the recently created
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , delivered a call to arms to the assembled data mavens. Don't be overly influenced, Mr. Etzioni warned, by the "big data tidal wave," with its emphasis on mining large data sets for correlations, inferences and predictions. The big data approach, he said during his talk and in an interview later, is brimming with short-term commercial opportunity, but he said scientists should set their sights further. "It might be fine if you want to target ads and generate product recommendations," he said, "but it's not common sense knowledge."
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 In his presentation, Mr. Etzioni acknowledged the gains made possible by big data methods - identifying patterns and calculating statistical probabilities - in tasks like speech recognition and computer vision. But he then proceeded to underline the limits of the big data approach. He showed the results when one types in "apple fruit" into Google and the Knowledge Graph result, the extracted facts that Google presents as a graphic, is mainly a list of nutritional elements of an an apple. The results from other services that assemble knowledge bases, Bing and Wolfram Alpha, were similar.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 But things that are readily understood by humans - that apples taste sweet and have a crunchy texture in the mouth when chewed, for example - are a challenge for the algorithms that generate digital databases.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20  "Current knowledge bases are full of facts," Mr. Etzioni observed, "but they are surprisingly knowledge poor."
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The "big" in big data tends to get all the attention, Mr. Etzioni said, but thorny problems often reside in a seemingly simple sentence or two. He showed the sentence: "The large ball crashed right through the table because it was made of Styrofoam." He asked, What was made of Styrofoam? The large ball? Or the table? The table, humans will invariably answer. But the question is a conundrum for a software program, Mr. Etzioni explained, because the correct answer involves both grammar and background knowledge. And the latter is something humans acquire through experience of the world.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Computers can't experience the world as humans do. And Mr. Etzioni is skeptical of the progress that will be possible with "deep learning," an artificial intelligence technique that uses the structure of the human brain as metaphorical inspiration for computer systems that process huge amounts of data.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Instead, at the Allen Institute, financed by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, Mr. Etzioni is leading a growing team of 30 researchers that is working on systems that move from data to knowledge to theories, and then can reason. The test, he said, is: "Does it combine things it knows to draw conclusions?" This is the step from correlation, probabilities and prediction to a computer system that can understand, in its way. That seems a steep climb of the semantic ladder of meaning. "We are trying to build these semantic models," Mr. Etzioni noted. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Mr. Etzioni's presentation was titled, "The Battle for the Future of Data Mining." But other computer scientists see the big data approach and the quest for understanding described by Mr. Etzioni as less a battle than different yet complementary paths, heading in the same broad direction. The long-range promise, they say, is technology that becomes a layer of data-driven artificial intelligence that resides on top of both the physical and digital worlds, helping people to make faster and smarter decisions as a kind of clever software assistant.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Mr. Etzioni, other scientists say, makes a good point, but the current enthusiasm for big data methods is understandable. "The dramatic successes of big data have caused everyone to rush over to that side of the boat," said Edward Lazowska, a professor at the University of Washington, who is on the board of the Allen Institute.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 And the correlation and prediction of 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  has certainly been good to Mr. Etzioni, whose talents include being a successful entrepreneur. He was a founder of Farecast, whose software predicted the best time to buy airline tickets. Microsoft bought Farecast in 2008. He was also a founder of Decide, a web site that sifted through historical price data and user recommendations to help consumers make buying decisions. Ebay purchased Decide in 2013.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The keynote speaker on Tuesday morning, 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Eric Horvitz,
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  a computer scientist at Microsoft Research, emphasized all that can be done with big data tools. His talk was titled, "Data, Predictions, and Decisions in Support of People and Society." In his presentation, Mr. Horvitz described several projects he and his team were working on. One involves using patient, treatment and historical data to predict which hospital patients are most at risk of being readmitted within 30 days, and suggest follow-up monitoring. Studies show that 20 percent of Medicare patients return to the hospital within 30 days at an estimated cost of $17.5 billion a year, in addition to the toll in human suffering.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Later, in a hallway conversation, a university computer scientist asked Mr. Horvitz about whether the software draws conclusions about the causes of hospital re-admissions. You can construct plausible explanations from the data, Mr. Horvitz replied. "But we don't care," he added. "Of course, we care in general. But it doesn't matter to the effectiveness of the technology."
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In an interview, Mr. Horvitz, who is an academic adviser to the Allen Institute, agreed with Mr. Etzioni that the long-range goal is computer systems that can reason rather than merely recognize patterns and correlations and make predictions. But Mr. Horvitz chose a different emphasis. "I think we can have a huge impact in so many fields, in the shorter term, along the way to reasoning systems," Mr. Horvitz said.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Many doctors report an uptick in patients suffering from stress-related hair loss. Here's what to do about it.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 With every month that passed in 2020, Samantha Hill's part seemed to widen, the increasingly bald stripe of skin a representation of what she calls ''a four-part terrible play'' in her life. Reeling from the death of her father in January, Ms. Hill, a 29-year-old freelance photographer, had barely adjusted to her new normal when the pandemic hit and further upended her life. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   After the death of a friend in June, when her hair appeared to thin even more, she created a folder on her phone titled Hairgate, featuring every selfie she'd taken in the last four years.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''I was trying to figure out where it all went wrong,'' said Ms. Hill, who lives in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   It's a quandary many people, particularly women, have agonized over in recent months, as their brushes and shower drains filled with tangles of hair. Google searches for hair loss increased by 8 percent in the last 12 months, according to the 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  firm Spate, with the topic being searched an average of more than 829,000 times a month in the United States.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The phenomenon is not all in our heads, according to experts, but is another frustrating byproduct of both immense stress and post-viral inflammation from Covid-19. Known as telogen effluvium in the medical world, temporary hair loss results from fever, illness and severe stress, pushing more hairs than normal into the shedding phase of the hair growth life cycle.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Although hair loss tends to be associated with men because of the prevalence of male-pattern baldness, telogen effluvium is more common among women, who often experience it after childbirth.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Any type of severe stress can trigger it, whether it's stress on your body from illness or emotional stress such as the death of a loved one,'' said Dr. Abigail Cline, a dermatologist at New York Medical College who has conducted research on pandemic-related hair loss. ''Even though not everyone has been infected with Covid-19, we're all living with it.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Tackling Hair Loss Holistically
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   For those who have had the virus, hair loss has become a common symptom of the recovery process, usually occurring three to four months after getting sick but sometimes experienced sooner. Dr. Jerry Shapiro, a dermatologist at NYU Langone Health who specializes in hair loss, said that while a healthy head of hair usually includes 90 percent anagen, or growing, hairs and 10 percent telogen, or resting, hairs, that ratio can shift up to 50-50 after experiencing a high fever or flulike illness.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   For Misty Gant, a 35-year-old wellness coach living on the Lower East Side, the change happened fast. After being infected in March, Ms. Gant started losing handfuls of her long red hair in the shower and began to notice balding at her temples a few weeks after recovering.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''It was really hard because my hair is important to me -- it's part of my identity,'' she said, noting that before it thinned, it was her most complimented feature.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Ms. Gant, who regularly dives into health and wellness research for clients, soon landed in forums full of people who had gone through similar post-Covid-19 hair loss. After doctors confirmed her suspicion that she was suffering from a post-viral inflammatory response, she readied an arsenal of holistic remedies to try to fix it.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Her first point of attack was an anti-inflammatory diet that cut out sugar, gluten, dairy and alcohol and incorporated colorful fruits and vegetables, oily fish and healthy fats like avocados and nuts. She kick-started a new supplement routine of Omega 3-6-9, turmeric with fenugreek, evening primrose oil and two tablespoons of aloe juice a day, a combination she believes to be anti-inflammatory and lubricating for the skin and hair.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   She began giving herself daily scalp massages using Bumble and Bumble Tonic Primer, which includes rosemary oil, an ingredient that some studies have found to encourage hair growth. Two days a week she doused her hair in a mixture of coconut oil and pure rosemary oil and left it in for 24 hours. Though not a quick fix, it seemed to pay off: She now has tufts of baby hair growing in at her temples.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''I try to do everything the natural way, and as a wellness practitioner, I know that things take time,'' Ms. Gant said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   A Less Intensive Approach
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Although it can still take months to see a significant difference, many people have had similar results from a combination of supplements, thickening shampoos and illusion-creating haircuts.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   After her husband noticed a few bald spots on the back of her head early in the pandemic, Martyna Szabadi, a 34-year-old business consultant who hasn't had Covid-19, experimented with products said to promote hair growth, including various scalp scrubs, a hair serum from the Ordinary and a daily drink of flax seed water. Nothing helped until she began using RevitaLash Thickening Shampoo and Conditioner and taking four capsules of Nutrafol core supplement for women.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''After half a year of this combination, I finally have the hair issue under control,'' Ms. Szabadi said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Nutrafol supplements also seemed to help Ms. Hill get her hair back on track after she began taking them in July, leaving her with a slimmer part and new hair growth around the crown. It was a boom year for the company, with revenue increasing 60 percent in 2020 compared to 2019, according to Giorgos Tsetis, the chief executive and a founder of the company.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mr. Tsetis said that 80 percent of the company's sales increase can be attributed to its two core formulas for women: Nutrafol Women and Women's Balance. They include ingredients like vitamin A, vitamin D, zinc and biotin, the last of which has become widely known as a hair growth supplement despite the fact that dermatologists disagree over its efficacy.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''No one's really been able to prove it helps hair in a randomized controlled study, and they've had a long time to prove it,'' Dr. Shapiro said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   But with wellness ruling the day, Nutrafol's chemical-free, made-from-the-earth virtue has made it a popular option. Nutrafol bills itself as a ''natural, holistic'' alternative to old-school remedies like Rogaine, or minoxidil, which is a topical solution used to improve blood flow and stimulate hair growth.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Another treatment option is platelet rich plasma therapy, known as P.R.P., which involves the injection of a patient's own blood into the scalp to stimulate hair growth. Priced between $500 and $1,800, P.R.P. doesn't work for everyone and is best done alongside other treatments, according to Dr. Shapiro, who believes it's a better fit for people experiencing female or male-pattern baldness, which has a genetic cause.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The Quicker Fix
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   If waiting three months for a shampoo or supplement to kick in doesn't thrill you, consider a haircut that will make your hair look healthier than it is. Justine Marjan, a hairstylist whose clients include Kardashians and the model Ashley Graham, recommends a shorter, blunt cut to create an illusion of thickness.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''It's best to avoid longer looks, as the hair can end up looking weak and frail at the ends,'' Ms. Marjan said. If your hair loss is most noticeable at your hairline or part, she suggests using an eye shadow or root touch-up spray that matches your hair color to create depth and the appearance of fullness. Using headband-style extensions that you can easily pop on and off without damaging the hair is another favorite trick.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Most important, be gentle and strategic with your hair. Ms. Marjan recommends drying fragile hair with a soft microfiber towel and using a tool like the Tangle Teezer to prevent breakage. Sleeping on a silk pillowcase is also believed to minimize breakage. And, while many people resort to ponytails when their hair is limp, it's best to avoid tight styling that could pull out more hair.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   What's definitely not great for hair growth? Constant panic.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Stressing about it will only cause more hair loss,'' Dr. Cline said, noting that a deep, six-month-long breath is a better prescription. ''I reassure patients with telogen effluvium that their hair will grow back, but it's going to take time.''

\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 At noon Eastern today, the House Financial Services Committee will dive into the meme-stock frenzy, interrogating some of the key players in the mania surrounding 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 GameStop
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  and other stocks favored by internet forums. 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 The hearing
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  \'97 in which most of the committee\'92s 53 members are set to participate \'97 threatens to be full of noise and bluster, as these events often are.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Here is who\'92s on deck to testify today, and questions that might elicit the most illuminating responses.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Vlad Tenev
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  of Robinhood. His online brokerage was the preferred venue for the frenzy, but its decision to halt some trading in GameStop and other stocks because of capital constraints prompted outrage across the political spectrum.\
\pard\tx760\pardeftab720\li760\fi-400\ri0\sl260\sb120\qj\partightenfactor0
\ls17\ilvl0\cf0 \'95	You\'92ve been lobbying for real-time settlement of stock trades, saying the current two-day delay led to Robinhood\'92s trading curbs. If there had been real-time settlement, would your brokerage have had enough capital to avoid restrictions at the height of the frenzy?\
\pard\tx760\pardeftab720\li760\fi-400\ri0\sl260\sb120\qj\partightenfactor0
\ls18\ilvl0\cf0 \'95	Robinhood says it offers retail investors free trading, but that\'92s because your company sells customer trades to market makers like Citadel Securities. Can you explain the benefit to firms that pay you to execute trades?\
\pard\tx760\pardeftab720\li760\fi-400\ri0\sl260\sb120\qj\partightenfactor0
\ls19\ilvl0\cf0 \'95	Brokerages lend their clients\'92 shares to short sellers. Would you consider asking Robinhood users to opt in to allow the lending of their holdings?\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Ken Griffin
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  of Citadel Securities. 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 The billionaire\'92s business empire
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  includes both a huge hedge fund that had bet against GameStop and a giant market maker that executes trades for Robinhood and others.\
\pard\tx760\pardeftab720\li760\fi-400\ri0\sl260\sb120\qj\partightenfactor0
\ls20\ilvl0\cf0 \'95	How is letting firms like Citadel Securities pay to execute retail customers\'92 orders good for mainstream investors?\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Gabe Plotkin
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  of Melvin Capital. His hedge fund, and its big bet against GameStop, was a primary target of scorn by Reddit traders who sought to squeeze him out.\
\pard\tx760\pardeftab720\li760\fi-400\ri0\sl260\sb120\qj\partightenfactor0
\ls21\ilvl0\cf0 \'95	How does allowing stocks like GameStop\'92s to have short interest of more than 100 percent \'97 that is, more of a company\'92s shares being sold short than are available to trade \'97 make financial markets more efficient, as short sellers claim?\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Jennifer Schulp
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  of the Cato Institute. The director of financial regulation studies at the think tank plans to testify that the meme-stock phenomenon didn\'92t pose a systemic risk.\
\pard\tx760\pardeftab720\li760\fi-400\ri0\sl260\sb120\qj\partightenfactor0
\ls22\ilvl0\cf0 \'95	You say that the \'93unintended consequences\'94 of regulatory changes in response to the meme-stock mania should not be underestimated. What are the consequences of not acting? Should investors expect episodes like the GameStop frenzy to become a regular feature of markets?\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Steve Huffman
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  of Reddit. His online platform is the home of WallStreetBets, the forum that helped egg on the meme-stock frenzy.\
\pard\tx760\pardeftab720\li760\fi-400\ri0\sl260\sb120\qj\partightenfactor0
\ls23\ilvl0\cf0 \'95	You\'92ve said 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 there wasn\'92t much your company could do
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  to guard against market manipulation, but why shouldn\'92t your company be held liable if there is fraud on its platform?\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Keith Gill
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone . The registered broker who, in his personal time, 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 touted GameStop
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  on YouTube and Reddit, plans to tell Congress his social media messages were purely for educational purposes.\
\pard\tx760\pardeftab720\li760\fi-400\ri0\sl260\sb120\qj\partightenfactor0
\ls24\ilvl0\cf0 \'95	Away from your persona as \'93Roaring Kitty\'94 on YouTube, you were the director of financial wellness education at MassMutual. With your \'93financial wellness\'94 hat on, what would have been the message you gave clients about investing in GameStop?\
\pard\tx760\pardeftab720\li760\fi-400\ri0\sl260\sb120\qj\partightenfactor0
\ls25\ilvl0\cf0 \'95	You say you are \'93as bullish as I\'92ve ever been\'94 about GameStop. What\'92s your price target?\

\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Facebook and Google come to opposite conclusions on paying for news in Australia. A proposed law in the country would require platforms to 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 pay media publishers for content
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  that appears on their sites. In response, Google announced a deal with News Corp (
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 one of many this week
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone ), while Facebook 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 blocked all links to news articles

The Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine is effective against the South African strain. The shot generated a

The Texas freeze shakes up global oil markets. The cut in Texas shale production because of winter storms \'97 some four million barrels a day of output \'97 is

Rush Limbaugh dies at 70. The right-wing provocateur made talk radio 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 a potent force in business and politics
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone . Allies praised him as a trailblazer for political pundits; critics said he presaged the Trumpian politics of conspiracy mongering.\
Is Robinhood a cryptocurrency whale? The online brokerage appears to be the single biggest holder of Dogecoin, the digital token whose value has soared nearly 1,000 percent in recent weeks, 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 according to reports

\cf0 Everyone\'92s an influencer now\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 We are all conduits in the \'93
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 hype machine
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone ,\'94 according to the M.I.T. professor Sinan Aral, acting as data conveyors in online systems designed for \'93hypersocializing.\'94 The stunning rise (and fall) of GameStop\'92s stock, driven in part by individual investors coalescing on social media, shows the new power of connected crowds, Mr. Aral said in an interview with DealBook.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \'93Crowds can scale, collaborate and coordinate in ways we have never seen before,\'94 Mr. Aral said, and that power can be harnessed for good or ill. He analyzed 10 years of Twitter activity, and found that novelty travels far and fast, and that false news, which tends to be more novel than the truth, is shared more freely than facts.\
\pard\tx760\pardeftab720\li760\fi-400\ri0\sl260\sb120\qj\partightenfactor0
\ls26\ilvl0\cf0 \'95	This leads to the postmodern problem of \'93
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 hyperreality
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone ,\'94 in which simulations and symbols that feel real lead to disagreements over what is true.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 All investors speculate on as-yet-unrealized values, traditionally tied to financial fundamentals. For example, the trader Keith Gill (see above) 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 will testify today
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  that he believed the retailer GameStop could reinvent itself, justifying a higher share price. This was shared online and it convinced others. But as the crowd felt its power, the thesis became \'93let\'92s stick it to the hedge funds,\'94 Mr. Aral said. This didn\'92t alter GameStop\'92s prospects, but fortunes were gained and lost based on the power of a crowd to create a new reality.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 To harness the promise and minimize the perils of a \'93new social age,\'94 insights from 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  about the power of the \'93hype machine\'94 should be applied to design better policies, Mr. Aral said. \'93We need a national commission on technology now.\'94 \
\pard\tx760\pardeftab720\li760\fi-400\ri0\sl260\sb120\qj\partightenfactor0
\ls27\ilvl0\cf0 \'95	The professor also recommended that we all hone our reflective powers to become more discerning influencers. Here\'92s a puzzle to test your reflection: A bat and a ball cost $1.10. The bat costs a dollar more than the ball. How much does the ball cost? (
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Here\'92s the not-so-obvious answer

\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \'93It\'92s something that is certainly here to stay. Whether it is here to stay at these levels in the mid- to long term, we\'92ll have to see.\'94\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \'97 Thomas Gottstein, the C.E.O. of Credit Suisse, on SPACs. His firm\'92s advisory work for blank-check companies

\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Exclusive: Russell Westbrook\'92s bank shot\
The N.B.A. star Russell Westbrook is leading a $63 million investment in Varo Bank, a digital chartered bank, in a deal that DealBook hears values the company at about $1.3 billion. The funds will help Varo grow \'97 including in brand awareness \'97 and develop programs to promote financial literacy for people of color.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 An assist in expanding access. When Mr. Westbrook, the point guard for the Washington Wizards, and his investment partners approached Varo with the idea, the bank, having 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 recently raised more than $240 million
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  ahead of getting its bank charter, was not actively looking for more funds. But Varo\'92s C.E.O., Colin Walsh, said he and Mr. Westbrook, who will serve as an adviser to the bank, were \'93aligned from a mission perspective.\'94 Mr. Westbrook said his work with Varo will be \'93part of an economic revitalization for those who never had the access they deserved.\'94\
Shooting for an I.P.O. Varo was founded in 2015 and is backed by the likes of Warburg Pincus and TPG. The bank expects to go public \'93in the next couple of years\'94 and forecasts that it will be cash-flow positive this year, said Mr. Walsh. The 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 prospects for fintech regulation
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  under President Biden are up in the air, but Mr. Walsh said the company has \'93built really great relationships\'94 with regulators, who appreciate the \'93authenticity\'94 of its mission.\

\cf0 On that $500 million mistake\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Yesterday, we 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 recounted the saga
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  of Citigroup\'92s mistaken transfer of $900 million to creditors of Revlon, and why a judge ruled that a group refusing to return $500 million to the bank is allowed to keep it (pending appeal). Based on the deluge of opinions we received from readers, the ethics of this issue are fraught.\
Speaking of ethics, Randy Cohen, the original Ethicist columnist for The Times Magazine, weighed in. He is now the host of 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Person Place Thing
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , an interview show on public radio.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \'93When the creditors received a much bigger payment than expected, they knew or could easily have found out if it was sent in error: pick up the phone and ask. Since it was sent by mistake, the money must be returned. I know of no school of ethics that encourages exploiting an honest error. Similarly, if Citigroup strolls past Allstate, one of the creditors in the dispute, and Allstate sees it drop its wallet, then Allstate must return the wallet, not pocket the cash.\'94\

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Many doctors report an uptick in patients suffering from stress-related hair loss. Here\'92s what to do about it.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 With every month that passed in 2020, Samantha Hill\'92s part seemed to widen, the increasingly bald stripe of skin a representation of what she calls \'93a four-part terrible play\'94 in her life. Reeling from the death of her father in January, Ms. Hill, a 29-year-old freelance photographer, had barely adjusted to her new normal when the pandemic hit and further upended her life.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 After the death of a friend in June, when her hair appeared to thin even more, she created a folder on her phone titled Hairgate, featuring every selfie she\'92d taken in the last four years.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93I was trying to figure out where it all went wrong,\'94 said Ms. Hill, who lives in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It\'92s a quandary many people, particularly women, have agonized over in recent months, as their brushes and shower drains filled with tangles of hair. Google searches for hair loss increased by 8 percent in the last 12 months, according to the 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  firm Spate, with the topic being searched an average of more than 829,000 times a month in the United States.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The phenomenon is not all in our heads, according to experts, but is another frustrating byproduct of both immense stress and post-viral inflammation from Covid-19. Known as telogen effluvium in the medical world, temporary hair loss results from fever, illness and severe stress, pushing more hairs than normal into the shedding phase of the hair growth life cycle.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Although hair loss tends to be associated with men because of the prevalence of male-pattern baldness, telogen effluvium is 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 more common
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  among women, who often experience it after childbirth.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 \'93Any type of severe stress can trigger it, whether it\'92s stress on your body from illness or emotional stress such as the death of a loved one,\'94 said Dr. Abigail Cline, a dermatologist at New York Medical College who has conducted research on pandemic-related hair loss. \'93Even though not everyone has been infected with Covid-19, we\'92re all living with it.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Tackling Hair Loss Holistically
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 For those who have had the virus, hair loss has become a common symptom of the recovery process, usually occurring three to four months after getting sick but sometimes experienced sooner. Dr. Jerry Shapiro, a dermatologist at NYU Langone Health who specializes in hair loss, said that while a healthy head of hair usually includes 90 percent anagen, or growing, hairs and 10 percent telogen, or resting, hairs, that ratio can shift up to 50-50 after experiencing a high fever or flulike illness.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 For Misty Gant, a 35-year-old wellness coach living on the Lower East Side, the change happened fast. After being infected in March, Ms. Gant started losing handfuls of her long red hair in the shower and began to notice balding at her temples a few weeks after recovering.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93It was really hard because my hair is important to me \'97 it\'92s part of my identity,\'94 she said, noting that before it thinned, it was her most complimented feature.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Ms. Gant, who regularly dives into health and wellness research for clients, soon landed in forums full of people who had gone through similar post-Covid-19 hair loss. After doctors confirmed her suspicion that she was suffering from a post-viral inflammatory response, she readied an arsenal of holistic remedies to try to fix it.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Her first point of attack was an anti-inflammatory diet that cut out sugar, gluten, dairy and alcohol and incorporated colorful fruits and vegetables, oily fish and healthy fats like avocados and nuts. She kick-started a new supplement routine of Omega 3-6-9, turmeric with fenugreek, evening primrose oil and two tablespoons of aloe juice a day, a combination she believes to be anti-inflammatory and lubricating for the skin and hair.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 She began giving herself daily scalp massages using 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Bumble and Bumble Tonic Primer
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , which includes rosemary oil, an ingredient that some 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 studies
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  have found to encourage hair growth. Two days a week she doused her hair in a mixture of coconut oil and pure rosemary oil and left it in for 24 hours. Though not a quick fix, it seemed to pay off: She now has tufts of baby hair growing in at her temples.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 \'93I try to do everything the natural way, and as a wellness practitioner, I know that things take time,\'94 Ms. Gant said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 A Less Intensive Approach
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Although it can still take months to see a significant difference, many people have had similar results from a combination of supplements, thickening shampoos and illusion-creating haircuts.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 After her husband noticed a few bald spots on the back of her head early in the pandemic, Martyna Szabadi, a 34-year-old business consultant who hasn\'92t had Covid-19, experimented with products said to promote hair growth, including various scalp scrubs, a hair serum from the Ordinary and a daily drink of flax seed water. Nothing helped until she began using 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 RevitaLash
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  Thickening Shampoo and Conditioner and taking four capsules of 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Nutrafol
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  core supplement for women.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 \'93After half a year of this combination, I finally have the hair issue under control,\'94 Ms. Szabadi said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Nutrafol supplements also seemed to help Ms. Hill get her hair back on track after she began taking them in July, leaving her with a slimmer part and new hair growth around the crown. It was a boom year for the company, with revenue increasing 60 percent in 2020 compared to 2019, according to Giorgos Tsetis, the chief executive and a founder of the company.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Mr. Tsetis said that 80 percent of the company\'92s sales increase can be attributed to its two core formulas for women: Nutrafol Women and Women\'92s Balance. They include ingredients like vitamin A, vitamin D, zinc and biotin, the last of which has become widely known as a hair growth supplement despite the fact that dermatologists disagree over its efficacy.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93No one\'92s really been able to prove it helps hair in a randomized controlled study, and they\'92ve had a long time to prove it,\'94 Dr. Shapiro said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 But with wellness ruling the day, Nutrafol\'92s chemical-free, made-from-the-earth virtue has made it a popular option. Nutrafol bills itself as a \'93natural, holistic\'94 alternative to old-school remedies like Rogaine, or minoxidil, which is a topical solution used to improve blood flow and stimulate hair growth.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Another treatment option is platelet rich plasma therapy, known as P.R.P., which involves the injection of a patient\'92s own blood into the scalp to stimulate hair growth. Priced between $500 and $1,800, P.R.P. doesn\'92t work for everyone and is best done alongside other treatments, according to Dr. Shapiro, who believes it\'92s a better fit for people experiencing female or male-pattern baldness, which has a genetic cause.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The Quicker Fix
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 If waiting three months for a shampoo or supplement to kick in doesn\'92t thrill you, consider a haircut that will make your hair look healthier than it is. Justine Marjan, a hairstylist whose clients include Kardashians and the model Ashley Graham, recommends a shorter, blunt cut to create an illusion of thickness.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93It\'92s best to avoid longer looks, as the hair can end up looking weak and frail at the ends,\'94 Ms. Marjan said. If your hair loss is most noticeable at your hairline or part, she suggests using an eye shadow or root touch-up spray that matches your hair color to create depth and the appearance of fullness. Using headband-style extensions that you can easily pop on and off without damaging the hair is another favorite trick.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Most important, be gentle and strategic with your hair. Ms. Marjan recommends drying fragile hair with a soft microfiber towel and using a tool like the Tangle Teezer to prevent breakage. Sleeping on a silk pillowcase is also believed to minimize breakage. And, while many people resort to ponytails when their hair is limp, it\'92s best to avoid tight styling that could pull out more hair.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 What\'92s definitely not great for hair growth? Constant panic.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93Stressing about it will only cause more hair loss,\'94 Dr. Cline said, noting that a deep, six-month-long breath is a better prescription. \'93I reassure patients with telogen effluvium that their hair will grow back, but it\'92s going to take time.\'94

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Blush has become the unlikely makeup hero of the masked generation. Here's the new way to wear it.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It may be a surprise to learn that blush, a makeup item long associated with 1980s-style glamour, is poised to make a major comeback. While lipstick or contour can't be seen under our masks, and wearing lots of eye makeup feels like too much of a dedicated effort, blush is becoming the hero bit of makeup that can add an instant pop of color to the face. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Blush sales and searches appear to be increasing at a time when other makeup categories are not. According to new research from the data provider Semrush, blush is the third-most searched beauty product in the United States, and the 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  team at Pattern, an e-commerce partner, has reported a rise in demand for blush.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Adding face color is fun, after all. ''Too much time inside, without the inspiration of others and the opportunity to decorate our faces, makes it all the more fun when we can,'' said Caroline Barnes, a makeup artist. She recently did a high-impact blush look around the eyes of the actress Nicola Coughlan, who stars in the Shondaland period romp ''Bridgerton.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Here, then, are some new ways to wear blush -- how to choose the right color, how to apply it, and more -- in the age of wearing a mask.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Brighten Your Complexion
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   When used strategically, blush can infuse warmth into any complexion, a much-needed boost when you've been indoors for months. ''You can add instant brightness by adding touches of corals and pinks,'' Ms. Barnes said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   To warm up a complexion, she suggests applying it in a soft circular shape over the apples of your cheeks.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''If a complexion doesn't have enough life, there are so many ways to wear it,'' said Katie Jane Hughes, a makeup artist who works with Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. One of Ms. Hughes's favorite techniques is to go for a ''super-blushy look,'' making it the focus of your entire makeup look.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Go Retro
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   With mask wearing, blush has moved up, above the mask line, closer to the eyes and on the tops of cheekbones. ''The old way that I used to do it has become new again,'' said the makeup artist Sandy Linter, who wrote the book ''Disco Beauty'' and did makeup for Diana Ross, Jerry Hall and Jackie O. ''It's high up on the cheekbone, and then it swings into like a C shape into the temples. Make sure you blend it, so it doesn't look that obvious.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Ms. Barnes has also been using maximum blush and taking inspiration from the '70s and '80s, extending color over the eye socket and sweeping it up toward the temples. ''You can use the same shade over your entire lid or wash the blush over your usual eye shadow, either way works,'' she said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Ms. Hughes has been taking an equally retro approach, sweeping blush over the eyes and brow instead of doing a complicated eye makeup look. ''I think of it like a soft little accent in an '80s kind of way, all the way up into the eye and the brow,'' she said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Opt for Monochromatic Themes
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Another modern touch for those who aren't blush averse: Choose your blush and coordinate the rest of your makeup look to it. ''Pick whatever your color is, and make the blush and everything else match,'' said Ms. Hughes, who recently experimented with a bright pink style. ''Then just do loads of lashes. It's so chic and simple but impactful because it's harmonious.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mix and Match Your Colors
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The great thing about blush is that choosing the right color isn't hard, and the new style of blush favors the bold. Chiao Li Hsu, another makeup artist, said that there are no rules when it comes to color, and she works with neon yellows or vivid reds when applying blush over the apples of the cheeks and up into the eye sockets.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''You can use any color,'' Ms. Hsu said. She is also a fan of using draping techniques, taking deeper pinks and reds under the eyes and over the cheeks.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''It's fun to play with several shades and textures of pink to make a monochromatic look more exciting and to add a bit of depth,'' she said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Other makeup artists like to mix multiple colors to get a custom look. ''Enhance your bone structure by using a tone a couple of shades darker than your skin tone, mixed with a nude hue,'' Ms. Barnes said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Choose a Texture, and a Tool
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Today's blushes come in many textures -- cream, powder, liquid. When wearing a mask, a liquid tint that dries down is the most transfer-proof option. But you can also use blush to change the texture of your complexion overall.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Cream is great for dry skin,'' Ms. Barnes said. ''And powder for oily skin as a rule, but it's personal preference. Natural makeup works well with creams, but with powder you can be more direct on where you place it, and it tends to last longer.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Ms. Linter prefers to play with multiple textures. ''You can wear both textures at once and layer,'' she said. But the tool is just as important as the texture you choose. Opt for a sponge when using creams; fingers work fine with liquids; and use a brush for powders.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Brushes are very, very important,'' she said. ''Some big, soft brushes are very ineffective. They don't do anything. For blush, you need to have a pretty full-sized brush, but it needs to be a little on the firm side so that when you hit your skin, it controls the powder and keeps it so you can spread it correctly in the right place.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Blend, but Not Too Much
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Blending is the key to making blush modern, but not so much that you overdo it and lose the color.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''If I'm watching people put makeup on and they're not fans of blush, I can always tell because they'll apply it and then ferociously rub it in,'' Ms. Hughes said. ''What ends up happening is they rub it off as they're blending it in. Just pick up a tiny bit, apply it slowly. You shouldn't see the payoff immediately. You should see it gradually.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   At the end of the day, however, Ms. Hughes cautions that there are really no strict rules with blush. ''If you like an actual cheek moment, do it,'' she said. ''If you like a high-up-into-the-temples moment, you should do that. Experiment to see what you like.''

These graphs show the air quality for twelve major world cities from November 2018 to November 2019. The key for the amount of air pollution uses both the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\'92s air quality index and the PM2.5 concentration (airborne particulate matter suspended in air that has a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers \'97 more than 100 times thinner than a human hair).

\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone \'94 The number of deaths from outdoor particulate pollution is staggering: in 2015, 4,200,000 deaths worldwide with 88,000 deaths in the United States. Weakened regulations and a reduction in enforcement have led to an increase in 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 air pollution since 2016
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , reversing years of decline.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Anything that is burned causes air pollution: coal in power plants, gas in vehicles, chemicals in industry and wildfires. Evidence of wildfires in San Francisco, caused in part by climate change, can be seen in the spike in air pollution in its graph.\

\cf0 TIME SERIES GRAPH\
A time series graph shows how a numerical (quantitative) variable changes over time.\
In the World Cities Air Pollution graphs, the length of the bars represent the numerical variable of daily air pollution for November 2018 through October 2019. Air pollution is measured by the amount of airborne particulate matter that has a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers per cubic meter. The graphs\'92 scale shows the correspondence between the amount of particulate matter to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency air quality index, with a color range from green for good air to red for hazardous and extreme pollution.\
INTERVALS for GRAPH SCALES\
The space between each marked value on the scale of a bar graph is called an interval. The length of intervals are chosen based on the range of the values in the data set. Interval lengths on linear scales are equal. Some graphs are constructed using logarithmic scales, which have unequal length intervals.\
In the World Cities Air Pollution graphs, the interval length is equal to 25 micrograms per cubic meter). The intervals are marked by parallel horizontal dotted lines.\

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Blush has become the unlikely makeup hero of the masked generation. Here\'92s the new way to wear it.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It may be a surprise to learn that blush, a makeup item long associated with 1980s-style glamour, is poised to make a major comeback. While lipstick or contour can\'92t be seen under our masks, and wearing lots of eye makeup feels like too much of a dedicated effort, blush is becoming the hero bit of makeup that can add an instant pop of color to the face.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Blush sales and searches appear to be increasing at a time when other makeup categories are not. According to new research from the data provider Semrush, blush is the third-most searched beauty product in the United States, and the 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  team at Pattern, an e-commerce partner, has reported a rise in demand for blush.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Adding face color is fun, after all. \'93Too much time inside, without the inspiration of others and the opportunity to decorate our faces, makes it all the more fun when we can,\'94 said 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Caroline Barnes
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , a makeup artist. She recently did 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 a high-impact blush look
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone around the eyes of the actress Nicola Coughlan, who stars in the Shondaland period romp \'93Bridgerton.\'94
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Here, then, are some new ways to wear blush \'97 how to choose the right color, how to apply it, and more \'97 in the age of wearing a mask.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Brighten Your Complexion
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 When used strategically, blush can infuse warmth into any complexion, a much-needed boost when you\'92ve been indoors for months. \'93You can add instant brightness by adding touches of corals and pinks,\'94 Ms. Barnes said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 To warm up a complexion, she suggests applying it in a soft circular shape over the apples of your cheeks.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 \'93If a complexion doesn\'92t have enough life, there are so many ways to wear it,\'94 said 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Katie Jane Hughes
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , a makeup artist who works with Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. One of Ms. Hughes\'92s favorite techniques is to go for a \'93super-blushy look,\'94 making it the focus of your entire makeup look.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Go Retro
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 With mask wearing, blush has moved up, above the mask line, closer to the eyes and on the tops of cheekbones. \'93The old way that I used to do it has become new again,\'94 said the makeup artist Sandy Linter, who wrote the book \'93Disco Beauty\'94 and did makeup for Diana Ross, Jerry Hall and Jackie O. \'93It\'92s high up on the cheekbone, and then it swings into like a C shape into the temples. Make sure you blend it, so it doesn\'92t look that obvious.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Ms. Barnes has also been using maximum blush and taking inspiration from the \'9270s and \'9280s, extending color over the eye socket and sweeping it up toward the temples. \'93You can use the same shade over your entire lid or wash the blush over your usual eye shadow, either way works,\'94 she said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Ms. Hughes has been taking an equally retro approach, sweeping blush over the eyes and brow instead of doing a complicated eye makeup look. \'93I think of it like a soft little accent in an \'9280s kind of way, all the way up into the eye and the brow,\'94 she said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Opt for Monochromatic Themes
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Another modern touch for those who aren\'92t blush averse: Choose your blush and coordinate the rest of your makeup look to it. \'93Pick whatever your color is, and make the blush and everything else match,\'94 said Ms. Hughes, who recently experimented with a bright pink 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 style
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone . \'93Then just do loads of lashes. It\'92s so chic and simple but impactful because it\'92s harmonious.\'94
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Mix and Match Your Colors
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The great thing about blush is that choosing the right color isn\'92t hard, and the new style of blush favors the bold. 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Chiao Li Hsu
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , another makeup artist, said that there are no rules when it comes to color, and she works with 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 neon yellows
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  or 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 vivid reds
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  when applying blush over the apples of the cheeks and up into the eye sockets.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93You can use any color,\'94 Ms. Hsu said. She is also a fan of using draping techniques, taking deeper pinks and reds 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 under the eyes
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone and over the cheeks.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 \'93It\'92s fun to play with several shades and textures of pink to make a monochromatic look more exciting and to add a bit of depth,\'94 she said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Other makeup artists like to mix multiple colors to get a custom look. \'93Enhance your bone structure by using a tone a couple of shades darker than your skin tone, mixed with a nude hue,\'94 Ms. Barnes said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Choose a Texture, and a Tool
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Today\'92s blushes come in many textures \'97 cream, powder, liquid. When wearing a mask, a liquid tint that dries down is the most transfer-proof option. But you can also use blush to change the texture of your complexion overall.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93Cream is great for dry skin,\'94 Ms. Barnes said. \'93And powder for oily skin as a rule, but it\'92s personal preference. Natural makeup works well with creams, but with powder you can be more direct on where you place it, and it tends to last longer.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Ms. Linter prefers to play with multiple textures. \'93You can wear both textures at once and layer,\'94 she said. But the tool is just as important as the texture you choose. Opt for a sponge when using creams; fingers work fine with liquids; and use a brush for powders.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93Brushes are very, very important,\'94 she said. \'93Some big, soft brushes are very ineffective. They don\'92t do anything. For blush, you need to have a pretty full-sized brush, but it needs to be a little on the firm side so that when you hit your skin, it controls the powder and keeps it so you can spread it correctly in the right place.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Blend, but Not Too Much
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Blending is the key to making blush modern, but not so much that you overdo it and lose the color.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93If I\'92m watching people put makeup on and they\'92re not fans of blush, I can always tell because they\'92ll apply it and then ferociously rub it in,\'94 Ms. Hughes said. \'93What ends up happening is they rub it off as they\'92re blending it in. Just pick up a tiny bit, apply it slowly. You shouldn\'92t see the payoff immediately. You should see it gradually.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 At the end of the day, however, Ms. Hughes cautions that there are really no strict rules with blush. \'93If you like an actual cheek moment, do it,\'94 she said. \'93If you like a high-up-into-the-temples moment, you should do that. Experiment to see what you like.\'94

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Facebook was going to compete with Google for some advertising sales but backed away from the plan after the companies cut a preferential deal, according to court documents.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In 2017, Facebook said it was testing a new way of selling online advertising that would threaten Google's control of the digital ad market. But less than two years later, Facebook did an about-face and said it was joining an alliance of companies backing a similar effort by Google. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Facebook never said why it pulled back from its project, but evidence presented in an antitrust lawsuit filed by 10 state attorneys general last month indicates that Google had extended to Facebook, its closest rival for digital advertising dollars, a sweetheart deal to be a partner.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Details of the agreement, based on documents the Texas attorney general's office said it had uncovered as part of the multistate suit, were redacted in the complaint filed in federal court in Texas last month. But they were not hidden in a draft version of the complaint reviewed by The New York Times.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Executives at six of the more than 20 partners in the alliance told The Times that their agreements with Google did not include many of the same generous terms that Facebook received and that the search giant had handed Facebook a significant advantage over the rest of them.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The executives, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid jeopardizing their business relationships with Google, also said they had not known that Google had afforded such advantages to Facebook. The clear disparity in how their companies were treated by Google when compared to Facebook has not been previously reported.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The disclosure of the deal between the tech giants has renewed concerns about how the biggest technology companies band together to close off competition. The deals are often consequential, defining the winners and losers in various markets for technology services and products. They are agreed upon in private with the crucial deal terms hidden through confidentiality clauses.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Google and Facebook said that such deals were common in the digital advertising industry and that they were not thwarting competition.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Julie Tarallo McAlister, a Google spokeswoman, said the complaint ''misrepresents this agreement, as it does many other aspects of our ad tech business.'' She added that Facebook is one of many companies that participate in the Google-led program and that Facebook is a partner in similar alliances with other companies.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Christopher Sgro, a Facebook spokesman, said deals like its agreement with Google ''help increase competition in ad auctions,'' which benefits advertisers and publishers. ''Any suggestion that these types of agreements harm competition is baseless,'' he said. Google and Facebook declined to elaborate on the specifics of their deal.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The Wall Street Journal had reported on aspects of the draft complaint earlier.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The swell of recent antitrust cases filed against Google and Facebook has cast a spotlight on lucrative deals among Big Tech. In October, the Justice Department sued Google and homed in on an agreement with Apple to feature Google as the preselected search engine on iPhones and other devices.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''This idea that the major tech platforms are robustly competing against each other is very much overstated,'' said Sally Hubbard, a former assistant attorney general in New York's antitrust bureau who now works at Open Markets Institute, a think tank. ''In many ways, they reinforce each other's monopoly power.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Google and Facebook accounted for more than half of all digital advertising spending in 2019. In addition to displaying advertising on their own platforms, such as Google's search engine and Facebook's home page, websites, app developers and publishers rely on the companies to secure advertising for their pages.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The agreement between Facebook and Google, code-named ''Jedi Blue'' inside Google, pertains to a growing segment of the online advertising market called programmatic advertising. Online advertising pulls in hundreds of billions of dollars in global revenue each year, and the automated buying and selling of ad space accounts for more than 60 percent of the total, according to researchers.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   In the milliseconds between a user clicking on a link to a web page and the page's ads loading, bids for available ad space are placed behind the scenes in marketplaces known as exchanges, with the winning bid passed to an ad server. Because Google's ad exchange and ad server were both dominant, it often directed the business to its own exchange.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   A method called header bidding emerged, in part as a workaround to reduce reliance on Google's ad platforms. News outlets and other sites could solicit bids from multiple exchanges at once, helping to increase competition and leading to better prices for publishers. By 2016, more than 70 percent of publishers had adopted the technology, according to one estimate.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Seeing a potentially significant loss of business to header bidding, Google developed an alternative called Open Bidding, which supported an alliance of exchanges. While Open Bidding allows other exchanges to simultaneously compete alongside Google, the search company extracts a fee for every winning bid, and competitors say there is less transparency for publishers.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The threat of Facebook, one of the biggest ad buyers on the internet, supporting header bidding was a grave concern at Google. The draft of the complaint reviewed by The Times cited an email from a Google executive calling it an ''existential threat'' that required ''an all hands on deck approach.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Facebook announced in March 2017 that it was testing header bidding with publishers like The Washington Post, Forbes and The Daily Mail. Facebook also took a jab at Google, saying the digital ad industry had been handing over profits to ''third-party middlemen who make the rules and obfuscate the truth.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Before Google and Facebook signed the deal in Sept. 2018, Facebook executives outlined the company's options to Mark Zuckerberg, its chief executive, according to the draft of the complaint: hire hundreds more engineers and spend billions of dollars to compete against Google; exit the business; or do the deal.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   To many in the ad industry, Facebook joining Google's alliance felt like a reversal on header bidding. One Open Bidding partner said it had been excited to be in discussions with Facebook about setting up an alternative to Google's alliance only to have conversations abruptly cease in 2018.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Facebook disclosed that it had joined Google's program in one line in a Dec. 2018 blog post. But it did not reveal that Google, according to the draft complaint, provided Facebook with special information and speed advantages to help the company succeed in the auctions that it did not offer to other partners -- even including a guaranteed ''win rate.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   In this market, where fractions of a second count, a speed advantage was decisive. Facebook had 300 milliseconds to bid for ads, according to court documents. But the executives at Google's partner companies said they usually had just 160 milliseconds or less to bid.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Facebook had yet another advantage: Direct billing relationships with the sites where ads would appear, according to the court documents. For most other partners, Google controlled pricing information, effectively putting up a wall between Open Bidding participants and site owners and hiding how much of winning bids sites end up receiving, the executives at other companies said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Google agreed to help Facebook have a better understanding of who would be shown the ads by helping the company identify 80 percent of mobile users and 60 percent of web users, the documents said. But several other partners said they had little such help understanding who was being shown ads.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Adam Heimlich, the chief executive of Chalice Custom Algorithms, a marketing and 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  consulting company, said the deal gave Facebook so much advantage that it was like allowing the social network to ''start every tournament in the finals.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Facebook promised to bid on at least 90 percent of auctions when it could identify the end user and committed to spending a certain amount of money -- as much as $500 million a year by the fourth year of the agreement, according to the draft of the complaint. Facebook also demanded that data about its bids not be used by Google to manipulate auctions in its own favor, a level playing field not explicitly promised to other Open Bidding partners.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Perhaps the most serious claim in the draft complaint was that the two companies had predetermined that Facebook would win a fixed percentage of auctions that it bid on.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Unbeknown to other market participants, no matter how high others might bid, the parties have agreed that the gavel will come down in Facebook's favor a set number of times,'' the draft complaint said. A Google spokeswoman said Facebook must make the highest bid to win an auction, just like its other exchange and ad network partners.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   While both companies said that the deal is not an antitrust matter, they included a clause in the agreement that requires the parties to ''cooperate and assist'' each other if they are investigated for competition concerns over the partnership.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''The word 'antitrust' is mentioned no less than 20 times" throughout the agreement, the draft complaint said.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Facebook was going to compete with Google for some advertising sales but backed away from the plan after the companies cut a preferential deal, according to court documents.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 In 2017, Facebook said it was testing a new way of selling online advertising that would threaten 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Google\'92s
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  control of the digital ad market. But less than two years later, Facebook did an about-face and said it was joining an alliance of companies backing a similar effort by Google.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Facebook never said why it pulled back from its project, but evidence presented in an antitrust lawsuit 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 filed by 10 state attorneys general last month
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  indicates that Google had extended to 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Facebook
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , its closest rival for digital advertising dollars, a sweetheart deal to be a partner.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Details of the agreement, based on documents the Texas attorney general\'92s office said it had uncovered as part of the multistate suit, were redacted in the complaint filed in federal court in Texas last month. But they were not hidden in a draft version of the complaint reviewed by The New York Times.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Executives at six of the more than 20 partners in the alliance told The Times that their agreements with Google did not include many of the same generous terms that Facebook received and that the search giant had handed Facebook a significant advantage over the rest of them.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The executives, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid jeopardizing their business relationships with Google, also said they had not known that Google had afforded such advantages to Facebook. The clear disparity in how their companies were treated by Google when compared to Facebook has not been previously reported.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The disclosure of the deal between the tech giants has renewed concerns about how the biggest technology companies band together to close off competition. The deals are often consequential, defining the winners and losers in various markets for technology services and products. They are agreed upon in private with the crucial deal terms hidden through confidentiality clauses.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Google and Facebook said that such deals were common in the digital advertising industry and that they were not thwarting competition.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Julie Tarallo McAlister, a Google spokeswoman, said the complaint \'93misrepresents this agreement, as it does many other aspects of our ad tech business.\'94 She added that Facebook is one of many companies that participate in the Google-led program and that Facebook is a partner in similar alliances with other companies.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Christopher Sgro, a Facebook spokesman, said deals like its agreement with Google \'93help increase competition in ad auctions,\'94 which benefits advertisers and publishers. \'93Any suggestion that these types of agreements harm competition is baseless,\'94 he said. Google and Facebook declined to elaborate on the specifics of their deal.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The Wall Street Journal had reported on aspects of 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 the draft complaint
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  earlier.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The swell of recent antitrust cases filed against Google and Facebook has cast a spotlight on lucrative deals among Big Tech. In October, the Justice Department sued Google and homed in on an 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 agreement with Apple
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  to feature Google as the preselected search engine on iPhones and other devices.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 \'93This idea that the major tech platforms are robustly competing against each other is very much overstated,\'94 said Sally Hubbard, a former assistant attorney general in New York\'92s antitrust bureau who now works at Open Markets Institute, a think tank. \'93In many ways, they reinforce each other\'92s monopoly power.\'94
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Google and Facebook accounted for 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 more than half
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  of all digital advertising spending in 2019. In addition to displaying advertising on their own platforms, such as Google\'92s search engine and Facebook\'92s home page, websites, app developers and publishers rely on the companies to secure advertising for their pages.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The agreement between Facebook and Google, code-named \'93Jedi Blue\'94 inside Google, pertains to a growing segment of the online advertising market called programmatic advertising. Online advertising pulls in hundreds of billions of dollars in global revenue each year, and the automated buying and selling of ad space accounts for more than 60 percent of the total,
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 according to researchers
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone .
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 In the milliseconds between a user clicking on a link to a web page and the page\'92s ads loading, bids for available ad space are placed behind the scenes in marketplaces known as exchanges, with the winning bid passed to an ad server. Because Google\'92s ad exchange and ad server were both dominant, it often directed the business to its own exchange.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 A method called header bidding emerged, in part as a workaround to reduce reliance on Google\'92s ad platforms. News outlets and other sites could solicit bids from multiple exchanges at once, helping to increase competition and leading to better prices for publishers. By 2016, more than 70 percent of publishers had adopted the technology, according to
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 one estimate
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone .
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Nondenominational \'93spiritual companions\'94 offer to connect clients to the divine in their everyday life.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Last spring, after a divorce, Qadeera Ingram needed someone to talk to. Specifically, she wanted to be able to speak about spirituality and the bigger picture of her life.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Though Ms. Ingram, a 33-year-old government contractor in Goose Creek, S.C., is Christian, she isn\'92t a member of a church. So she hired Susan Pannier-Cass, a spiritual director and ordained minister, to talk about what she was experiencing, including raising her 6-year-old son in a pandemic at a time of widespread unrest.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In some of the virtual sessions, Ms. Ingram talked about her dreams, and Ms. Pannier-Cass would help her analyze them. In others, Ms. Ingram discussed elements of the natural world, how they made her feel closer to God. Ms. Pannier-Cass would encourage her \'93to go outside more and take my shoes off,\'94 Ms. Ingram said, \'93put my feet on the ground, just to reconnect with my center and what brings me peace.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Spiritual companions, also known as spiritual directors, are guides whose purpose is to listen deeply to clients and help them explore their spirituality, usually in a nondenominational capacity.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 What they offer is not therapy; 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 according to Spiritual Directors International
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , a nonprofit in Bellevue, Wash., the goal of meeting with a spiritual companion is to take a \'93meaningful step to help you find wholeness and balance in life, not to mention a sense of connection with however you might refer to God, Allah, The Universe, or the Ground of All Being, that which connects us all.\'94
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The practice has roots in many faiths, particularly the Jesuit branch of Catholicism, but contemporary spiritual directors come from a variety of religions.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93Most people come to spiritual direction looking for ultimate meaning, however they might define it. We don\'92t define it for them,\'94 said Seifu Anil Singh-Molares, a Zen Buddhist priest and the executive director of Spiritual Directors International. (While spiritual direction is the more familiar term, he said, he favors \'93spiritual companion\'94 because it is more inclusive.) \'93We support you in finding your own way to God, if that\'92s how you describe it, or Brahman, or Tao.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 \'93Spiritual but not religious\'94 is how 27 percent of Americans define themselves, according to 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 a Pew Research Center survey
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  from 2017. But one-quarter of American adults in 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 an April survey
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  from Pew reported that their religious faith has increased because of the pandemic.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 For some seeking spiritual connection, this results in a hybrid approach. Alissa Ballot, 65, another of Ms. Pannier-Cass\'92s clients and a retired lawyer in Chicago, was already a member of a synagogue when a retreat introduced her to spiritual companionship. She has found greater self-understanding by writing poetry at Ms. Pannier-Cass\'92s suggestion, she said. Spiritual direction is helping her \'93become the me that God intended and created me to be.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Lucinda Clark, a spiritual director in Charlotte, N.C., said that in her experience, more Black clients, including clergy members, are seeking spiritual direction after George Floyd\'92s death and the anger and protests that followed.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93That has been one of the main issues,\'94 said Ms. Clark, 51. \'93\'91How can I operate and work in my ministry in an environment that is unknowingly sometimes rejecting me and sometimes knowingly?\'92 And so, some people are coming because they\'92re hurt. They don\'92t know how to move forward.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Ms. Clark, who completed a three-year spiritual direction program at Charlotte Spirituality Center, became a spiritual director after what she describes as \'93a dark night of the soul\'94 in which she questioned certain ideologies in her church. She concluded that while she is rooted in Christianity, there are many paths to God.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Afterward, \'93I just knew that I needed to journey with other people, to partner with other people, so they didn\'92t feel alone,\'94 she said. \'93I thought, \'91I don\'92t know the name of this thing that I\'92m supposed to do. I just know that I\'92m supposed to do it.\'92\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 When she came across spiritual direction in an internet search, \'93I was like, \'91That is it!\'92\'94 she said. In her sessions, she often asks questions to help clients reflect on what they\'92re experiencing, from a hard day at work to a disconnection in their relationship with God.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Andrea Metz-Nicholson, 59, a spiritual director and one of Ms. Clark\'92s clients, believes the practice has given her greater self-awareness, an ability to voice difficult emotions, and a more intimate relationship with God. She has endured several family tragedies in recent years, and seeing Ms. Clark \'93just brought clarity,\'94 Ms. Metz-Nicholson said. \'93It brought me peace.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Others come to spiritual direction for guidance in reconciling their past faith with what they believe now, or merging their interfaith beliefs into a cohesive whole. \'93People are creating their own spiritual landscape,\'94 said Summer Albayati, 51, a spiritual director in Orange, Calif., who describes herself as a Unitarian Universalist Muslim minister.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Rabbi Adam Lavitt, 38, in Providence, R.I., who provides spiritual direction for rabbinical students, a senior living community and individual clients, likes to bring creativity into his sessions through activities like art and writing. The more people take pleasure in the process, he said, \'93the easier it is for them to hear their life, their soul, speaking to them.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Boundaries and Beyond
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Spiritual directors, unlike therapists, are not licensed clinicians. They are not regulated by any agency. Nor does Spiritual Directors International, one of the biggest organizations dedicated to spiritual companionship, or smaller organizations like Spiritual Directors of Color Network, offer any kind of independent certification.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Training can vary depending upon the practitioner\'92s faith background or educational preferences, but there are certificate programs through spiritual direction organizations and nonprofit ministries, including the Shalem Institute for Spiritual Formation in Washington, D.C.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Spiritual Directors International\'92s guidelines call for spiritual directors to have directors themselves, and mentors or peers to provide supervision and accountability. Fees for spiritual direction typically run on a sliding scale, up to $150 per 50-minute session. Some directors offer pro bono services for those who can\'92t afford to pay.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The relationship between companion and seeker is an intimate one, and just as in any kind of counseling, it\'92s important for spiritual directors to maintain appropriate boundaries. Some spiritual companions, including Ms. Pannier-Cass, have degrees in social work.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Emily Malcoun, a clinical psychologist in Philadelphia who has worked with a spiritual director, noted that while therapy \'93can provide expert help with healing from mental health symptoms,\'94 spiritual direction \'93focuses on your relationship with God or the divine\'94 through prayer or reflection.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Some advocate for more accountability in the profession. Andree Grafstein, a spiritual director in Avon, Conn., described an incident of sexual harassment from a director about 40 years ago in an article she published last fall in Presence, a journal published by Spiritual Directors International. \'93I look forward to a day when the reality of a spiritual director\'92s sexual harassment becomes as visible as other forms of sexual abuse have become,\'94 she wrote.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Since the article was published, Ms. Grafstein said she has received supportive emails from other spiritual directors. She is particularly concerned about the need to provide guidance and support for spiritual directors who learn that a directee has experienced harassment or abuse at the hands of another director.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Directees can be vulnerable, especially because, for some, rejection of organized religion or a former religious community is what brought them to a spiritual director in the first place. Kristabeth Atwood in Burlington, Vt., a spiritual director and former United Methodist minister, calls herself a pastor for people who don\'92t go to church. Most of her directees \'93just don\'92t resonate with being part of a traditional or formal religious community,\'94 she said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Others may be considering different denominations within their faith. Late last year Silas Bergen, 33, a statistics and 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  professor at Winona State University in Winona, Minn., decided to leave his church after working with a friend who was training to be a spiritual director.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Mr. Bergen, who had previously played piano for his church and even helped lead worship services, began to feel more and more at odds with the church\'92s conservative beliefs and doctrine, though they were familiar to him from what he describes as his \'93evangelical-flavored\'94 religious upbringing.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93I just began to feel this dissonance really strongly,\'94 he said. Through what began as monthly virtual conversations in summer 2019, he explored what form of Christianity would be meaningful to him now. He plans to consider new churches when in-person visits are possible.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93Where have I been? Where am I at with whatever I\'92ve been experiencing?\'94 Mr. Bergen said, describing his self-reflection process. \'93That encourages me to check in with myself, to maybe name the ways in which I\'92m noticing the divine in my everyday life.\'94

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Nondenominational ''spiritual companions'' offer to connect clients to the divine in their everyday life.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Last spring, after a divorce, Qadeera Ingram needed someone to talk to. Specifically, she wanted to be able to speak about spirituality and the bigger picture of her life. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Though Ms. Ingram, a 33-year-old government contractor in Goose Creek, S.C., is Christian, she isn't a member of a church. So she hired Susan Pannier-Cass, a spiritual director and ordained minister, to talk about what she was experiencing, including raising her 6-year-old son in a pandemic at a time of widespread unrest.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   In some of the virtual sessions, Ms. Ingram talked about her dreams, and Ms. Pannier-Cass would help her analyze them. In others, Ms. Ingram discussed elements of the natural world, how they made her feel closer to God. Ms. Pannier-Cass would encourage her ''to go outside more and take my shoes off,'' Ms. Ingram said, ''put my feet on the ground, just to reconnect with my center and what brings me peace.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Spiritual companions, also known as spiritual directors, are guides whose purpose is to listen deeply to clients and help them explore their spirituality, usually in a nondenominational capacity.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   What they offer is not therapy; according to Spiritual Directors International, a nonprofit in Bellevue, Wash., the goal of meeting with a spiritual companion is to take a ''meaningful step to help you find wholeness and balance in life, not to mention a sense of connection with however you might refer to God, Allah, The Universe, or the Ground of All Being, that which connects us all.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The practice has roots in many faiths, particularly the Jesuit branch of Catholicism, but contemporary spiritual directors come from a variety of religions.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Most people come to spiritual direction looking for ultimate meaning, however they might define it. We don't define it for them,'' said Seifu Anil Singh-Molares, a Zen Buddhist priest and the executive director of Spiritual Directors International. (While spiritual direction is the more familiar term, he said, he favors ''spiritual companion'' because it is more inclusive.) ''We support you in finding your own way to God, if that's how you describe it, or Brahman, or Tao.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Space for Seeking
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Spiritual but not religious'' is how 27 percent of Americans define themselves, according to a Pew Research Center survey from 2017. But one-quarter of American adults in an April survey from Pew reported that their religious faith has increased because of the pandemic.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   For some seeking spiritual connection, this results in a hybrid approach. Alissa Ballot, 65, another of Ms. Pannier-Cass's clients and a retired lawyer in Chicago, was already a member of a synagogue when a retreat introduced her to spiritual companionship. She has found greater self-understanding by writing poetry at Ms. Pannier-Cass's suggestion, she said. Spiritual direction is helping her ''become the me that God intended and created me to be.''

\f3\fs24 \

\cf0 This graph appeared in the Aug. 16, 2020 opinion article \'93
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Racism\'92s Hidden Toll
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone .\'94 This graph shows the gap between Black and white mortality rates in 2018 for the top 15 causes of death. The horizontal axis shows the difference in mortality rates for each cause of death. The width of each bar represents the combined mortality rate for Black and white people. The mortality rates are expressed as deaths by cause per 100,000 people. The article has two other graphs that are other ways to show the mortality gap between Black and white people for the years 1900 to 2018.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 What is the cause of these significantly different health outcomes? The New York Times article cites Jay Pearson, an assistant professor of public policy at Duke University, who says the difference in health outcomes cannot be completely explained by genetics, income, education and behavior. \'93What we\'92re really talking about is structural racism,\'94 concludes Dr. Pearson. The article explains in more depth how researchers came to this conclusion.\
These graphs only include data for 2018. Regarding the Covid-19 pandemic, the article states that \'93Black people are three times more likely than white people to contract the coronavirus, six times more likely to be hospitalized as a result and twice as likely to die of Covid-19.\'94 Some reasons for this difference include that proportionately more Black people than white people have jobs that limit their ability to socially distance, live in overcrowded housing that may be closer to environmental hazards, and have more limited health care.\
Study the graph. Read the article. Read some of the 274 comments, especially the Reader and NYT Picks. What do you think about the disparate health outcomes of Black and white people? What could be done about this?\
Here are some of the student headlines that capture the story of these maps: \'93Inequality in Life, Inequality in Death\'94 by Paul of Memphis and \'93Differences in Death Rates: The Race Gap\'94 by IMEG of Eden Prairie, Minnesota.\

\cf0 BAR MEKKO CHART\
 A bar mekko chart is a bar chart with variable bar widths. Both bar charts and bar mekko charts show numerical values associated with the categories of a categorical variable. For a bar chart, the value is often (but not always) the frequency of occurrence in a categorical data set and the bars all have the same width. A bar mekko chart adds information on an additional variable that is represented by the width of the bars. The width of the bar shows the relative importance of each bar.\
In the Mortality by Race graph, the categories are the top 15 causes of death. The two variables for each of the causes are the gap in the death rate between Black and white people per 100,000, represented by the bar length and the death rate for Black and white people per 100,000, represented by the bar width. The length of the heart disease bar shows that Black people have more than 40 deaths per 100,000 more than white people. The width of the bars clearly show that heart disease is the top cause of death. The area of the bars has no meaning. However, the order of their areas from largest to smallest, does show the relative number of deaths for each cause of death.\
RATE\
Rate is the count of some characteristic of a group divided by the total number of members in the group or the total value of a group. Rates can be expressed as percentages, decimals, fractions, or per capita values. Rates, rather numbers, are often used to make more meaningful comparisons between diverse groups.\
In the Mortality by Race graph, the deaths by cause are expressed as rates rather than numbers. Because there are about 200 million white people but only about 40 million Black people, you would expect more white people deaths by cause. But if the deaths are converted to the number of deaths per 100,000 people, we can compare deaths for the same 100,000 population size. In addition, for this graph, rates are adjusted for age, so the two groups have the same age distribution.\

\f2\fs20 \cf0 This year, technology firms big and small stepped up to help with the Covid-19 pandemic and other thorny challenges.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Some years, I have to dig deep to come up with worthy honorees for the Good Tech Awards, my annual column that honors what I consider the most humane and altruistic tech projects of the year. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Not in 2020, though. This year, technology did more for us than ever -- helping us work from home, set up remote schools, communicate with our loved ones, organize for racial justice, protect the integrity of an election and keep the economy running during a pandemic. And all over the world, technologists stepped up to help solve critical problems and keep us safe.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Plenty of large tech companies gave money to Covid-19 relief efforts, antiracism groups and other philanthropic causes. Others donated personal protective equipment from their corporate stockpiles, or built apps for contact tracing and other critical pandemic tasks.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   But there were less-heralded tech contributions that made a real difference this year, and the people behind them deserve credit. So let's give thanks to a few of the technologists who stepped up in 2020.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   To U.S. Digital Response, for pandemic-proofing our infrastructure.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   In March, as Covid-19 began spreading across the country, a group of tech workers assembled in Slack rooms and on Zoom calls to figure out how they could use their tech expertise to help with the crisis. The result was the U.S. Digital Response, now a network of over 6,000 coders, data scientists and researchers who are helping local and state governments respond to Covid-19.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   So far, the group -- which is led by Raylene Yung, a former Facebook and Stripe executive, and includes volunteers from most of Silicon Valley's biggest companies -- has taken on pro bono projects in dozens of states. It helped Pennsylvania's Health Department set up an online data dashboard to track the number of available hospital beds and ventilators. It helped Seattle health officials set up an online testing hub, and rebuilt a Kansas Department of Labor website that was used to file for unemployment benefits.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Ideally, cities and states would have enough money and technical expertise to do these things themselves. But until that happens, we're lucky that the U.S.D.R. is stepping in to fill the gaps.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   To Perimeter, Technosylva and Ignis, for helping put out the fires.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Because of climate change, we're probably in for many more wildfires like the ones that burned through the West Coast this summer, driving hundreds of thousands of people from their homes. But in future years, we might be better equipped to deal with them thanks to tools like those made by Perimeter, Technosylva and Ignis, three start-ups that are trying to modernize the firefighter's outdated arsenal.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Perimeter, a small start-up in the Bay Area, makes collaborative mapping and data-sharing software for emergency workers. Its founder, Bailey Farren, is the 24-year-old daughter of a retired fire captain and a paramedic. After she and her family were forced to evacuate during the 2017 Tubbs fire, she saw the need for a better communication system than the two-way radios and paper maps that emergency workers often used. Perimeter's app, which allows fire departments to share real-time evacuation routes and safety updates, is being tested in California cities including Palo Alto and Petaluma, and the company plans to expand to other states soon.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Technosylva, another California start-up, makes predictive modeling software that allows fire departments to calculate where a fire is heading, how fast it's moving and what weather patterns might affect its path. Its software is used in nine states, and helped the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection predict the trajectory of wildfires this year, saving valuable time for those trying to extinguish the blazes.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Ignis, created by a Nebraska company, Drone Amplified, is used for ''prescribed burns'' -- small fires purposely set in the path of a larger wildfire to steal its fuel. The system attaches to a drone, and drops small incendiaries known as ''dragon eggs'' from a safe height, at a much lower cost and personal risk than a helicopter. Ignis was used to battle fires in Colorado, California and Oregon this year, and recently struck a partnership with the U.S. Forest Service.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   To Our Data Bodies and Data for Black Lives, for fueling tech's racial reckoning.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   When George Floyd was killed in May, lots of Silicon Valley tech companies raced to voice their support for racial justice. But many of those companies have continued to make products that put Black communities at risk -- whether it's through amplifying misinformation, deploying biased artificial intelligence or perpetuating racism in their work forces.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   This year, I've been more impressed by community-based efforts I've seen to support Black Lives Matter and other anti-racist movements using the tools of technology to hold institutions accountable. One of these efforts, Our Data Bodies, is an education project run by researchers and organizers in Los Angeles; Detroit; Charlotte, N.C.; and other cities. It has worked to teach communities of color how their personal data is collected and used by tech firms and government agencies. This year, it hosted virtual trainings for community organizers to teach them how to fight potentially harmful technologies like facial recognition.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Another effort, Data for Black Lives, is a group of technologists and activists led by Yeshimabeit Milner who are using the tools of 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  to empower Black communities. This year, the group compiled state-level data about the impact of Covid-19 on Black people, and it is in the early stages of putting together a nationwide database of technologies used by police departments, with evidence of how those technologies disproportionately harm Black people.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   To Frontline Foods, for feeding our health care heroes.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Last spring, when hospitals were filling up with Covid-19 patients and restaurants were struggling to survive, Frank Barbieri and Ryan Sarver, two San Francisco tech veterans, and their friend Sydney Gressel, a nurse in the medical system of the University of California, San Francisco, came up with the idea of connecting hungry frontline health workers with local restaurants that badly needed more business. They began raising money and soliciting help from their networks in the tech community to send restaurant meals to health workers, and Frontline Foods was born.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Today, Frontline Foods is part of World Central Kitchen, the nonprofit started by the chef Jos\'e9 Andr\'e9s. It has raised more than $10 million, has hundreds of volunteers throughout the country coordinating meal drop-offs using tools like Slack and AirTable, and has served more than 500,000 meals to hospitals and clinics, while keeping many struggling restaurants busy and afloat.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   To Jackbox Games, for livening up my quarantine.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   I've always been a gamer, but 2020 was the year I needed games to escape the stressful and depressing reality of pandemic life. And of all the games I played, the simple, party-style games with friends and family over Zoom gave me the most joy. Many were made by Jackbox Games.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Jackbox is best known for its ''party packs'' of games you can play remotely with groups. (I'm partial to Quiplash, in which you compete to come up with funny responses to prompts like ''The worst thing to hear during a massage.'') The company's pandemic-fueled boom -- it has more than doubled its user base this year -- may fade when we can all go outside and see our friends in person again. But it has been invaluable for my sanity this year.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   To the scientists developing Covid-19 vaccines, for getting us back to normal.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The most important innovation of the year, by a mile, wasn't really ''technology'' in the conventional, Silicon Valley sense of the word. But make no mistake: The scientists at Pfizer, Moderna, BioNTech, the National Institutes of Health, and other pharmaceutical companies and research labs whose work led to the first approved Covid-19 vaccines are innovators of the highest order, and they probably did more to alleviate human suffering this year than all the app developers and hardware makers in the world combined.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   These scientists -- and the teams that supported them -- worked under enormous pressure and crushing deadlines to develop a new kind of mRNA vaccine for the coronavirus, guide it through clinical trials and get it out to the public in record time. The vaccines are a true triumph of science, and because of these people's hard work, hundreds of millions of Americans will get to spend some or most of 2021 hugging their relatives, reopening their businesses, traveling safely and doing all of the socially un-distant things that give us meaning and joy.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Plenty of large tech companies 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 gave money to Covid-19 relief efforts
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 antiracism groups
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  and other philanthropic causes. Others 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 donated
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  personal protective equipment from their corporate stockpiles, or 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 built apps for contact tracing
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  and other critical pandemic tasks.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 But there were less-heralded tech contributions that made a real difference this year, and the people behind them deserve credit. So let\'92s give thanks to a few of the technologists who stepped up in 2020.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 To U.S. Digital Response, for pandemic-proofing our infrastructure.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 In March, as Covid-19 began spreading across the country, a group of tech workers assembled in Slack rooms and on Zoom calls to figure out how they could use their tech expertise to help with the crisis. The result was the 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 U.S. Digital Response
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , now a network of over 6,000 coders, data scientists and researchers who are 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 helping local and state governments respond
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  to Covid-19.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 So far, the group \'97 which is led by Raylene Yung, a former Facebook and Stripe executive, and includes volunteers from most of Silicon Valley\'92s biggest companies \'97 has taken on pro bono projects in dozens of states. It helped Pennsylvania\'92s Health Department set up an online data dashboard to track the number of available hospital beds and ventilators. It helped Seattle health officials set up an online testing hub, and rebuilt a Kansas Department of Labor website that was used to file for unemployment benefits.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Ideally, cities and states would have enough money and technical expertise to do these things themselves. But until that happens, we\'92re lucky that the U.S.D.R. is stepping in to fill the gaps.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 To Perimeter, Technosylva and Ignis, for helping put out the fires.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Because of climate change, we\'92re probably in for many more wildfires like the ones that burned through the West Coast this summer, driving hundreds of thousands of people from their homes. But in future years, we might be better equipped to deal with them thanks to tools like those made by Perimeter, Technosylva and Ignis, three start-ups that are trying to modernize the firefighter\'92s outdated arsenal.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f4\i\fs20 \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Perimeter
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , a small start-up in the Bay Area, makes collaborative mapping and data-sharing software for emergency workers. Its founder, Bailey Farren, is the 24-year-old daughter of a retired fire captain and a paramedic. After she and her family were forced to evacuate during the 2017 Tubbs fire, she saw the need for a better communication system than the two-way radios and paper maps that emergency workers often used. Perimeter\'92s app, which allows fire departments to share real-time evacuation routes and safety updates, is being tested in California cities including Palo Alto and Petaluma, and the company plans to expand to other states soon.
\f3\fs24 \

\f4\i\fs20 \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Technosylva
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , another California start-up, makes predictive modeling software that allows fire departments to calculate where a fire is heading, how fast it\'92s moving and what weather patterns might affect its path. Its software is used in nine states, and helped the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection predict the trajectory of wildfires this year, saving valuable time for those trying to extinguish the blazes.
\f3\fs24 \

\f4\i\fs20 \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Ignis
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , created by a Nebraska company, Drone Amplified, is used for \'93prescribed burns\'94 \'97 small fires purposely set in the path of a larger wildfire to steal its fuel. The system attaches to a drone, and drops small incendiaries known as \'93dragon eggs\'94 from a safe height, at a much lower cost and personal risk than a helicopter. Ignis was used to battle fires in Colorado, California and Oregon this year, and recently struck a partnership with the U.S. Forest Service.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 To Our Data Bodies and Data for Black Lives, for fueling tech\'92s racial reckoning.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 When George Floyd was killed in May, lots of Silicon Valley tech companies raced to voice their support for racial justice. But many of those companies have continued to make products that put Black communities at risk \'97 whether it\'92s through 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 amplifying misinformation
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 deploying biased artificial intelligence
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  or 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 perpetuating racism
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  in their work forces.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This year, I\'92ve been more impressed by community-based efforts I\'92ve seen to support Black Lives Matter and other anti-racist movements using the tools of technology to hold institutions accountable. One of these efforts, 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Our Data Bodies
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , is an education project run by researchers and organizers in Los Angeles; Detroit; Charlotte, N.C.; and other cities. It has worked to teach communities of color how their personal data is collected and used by tech firms and government agencies. This year, it hosted virtual trainings for community organizers to teach them how to fight potentially harmful technologies like facial recognition.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Another effort, 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Data for Black Lives
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , is a group of technologists and activists led by Yeshimabeit Milner who are using the tools of 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  to empower Black communities. This year, the group 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 compiled
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  state-level data about the impact of Covid-19 on Black people, and it is in the early stages of putting together a nationwide database of technologies used by police departments, with evidence of how those technologies disproportionately harm Black people.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 To Frontline Foods, for feeding our health care heroes.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Last spring, when hospitals were filling up with Covid-19 patients and restaurants were struggling to survive, Frank Barbieri and Ryan Sarver, two San Francisco tech veterans, and their friend Sydney Gressel, a nurse in the medical system of the University of California, San Francisco, came up with the idea of connecting hungry frontline health workers with local restaurants that badly needed more business. They began raising money and soliciting help from their networks in the tech community to send restaurant meals to health workers, and 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Frontline Foods
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  was born.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Today, Frontline Foods is part of World Central Kitchen, the nonprofit started by the chef Jos\'e9 Andr\'e9s. It has raised more than $10 million, has hundreds of volunteers throughout the country coordinating meal drop-offs using tools like Slack and AirTable, and has served more than 500,000 meals to hospitals and clinics, while keeping many struggling restaurants busy and afloat.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 To Jackbox Games, for livening up my quarantine.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 I\'92ve always been a gamer, but 2020 was the year I needed games to escape the stressful and depressing reality of pandemic life. And of all the games I played, the simple, party-style games with friends and family over Zoom gave me the most joy. Many were made by 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Jackbox Games
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone .
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Jackbox is best known for its \'93party packs\'94 of games you can play remotely with groups. (I\'92m partial to Quiplash, in which you compete to come up with funny responses to prompts like \'93The worst thing to hear during a massage.\'94) The company\'92s 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 pandemic-fueled boom
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  \'97 it has more than doubled its user base this year \'97 may fade when we can all go outside and see our friends in person again. But it has been invaluable for my sanity this year.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 To the scientists developing Covid-19 vaccines, for getting us back to normal.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The most important innovation of the year, by a mile, wasn\'92t really \'93technology\'94 in the conventional, Silicon Valley sense of the word. But make no mistake: The scientists at Pfizer, Moderna, BioNTech, the National Institutes of Health, and other pharmaceutical companies and research labs whose work led to the first approved Covid-19 vaccines are innovators of the highest order, and they probably did more to alleviate human suffering this year than all the app developers and hardware makers in the world combined.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 These scientists \'97 and the teams that supported them \'97 worked under enormous pressure and crushing deadlines to 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 develop
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  a new kind of mRNA vaccine for the coronavirus, guide it through clinical trials and get it out to the public in record time. The vaccines are a true triumph of science, and because of these people\'92s hard work, hundreds of millions of Americans will get to spend some or most of 2021 hugging their relatives, reopening their businesses, traveling safely and doing all of the socially un-distant things that give us meaning and joy.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Ultranauts has been developing creative ways to hire, manage and motivate a far-flung and diverse work force for seven years.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 From her home in Beaverton, Ore., Jamie Davila leads a team of eight engineers in seven states for the technology start-up Ultranauts. Like millions of other people during these work-from-home times, she relies on popular communication tools like Zoom and Slack. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   But Ms. Davila and Ultranauts also work remotely in ways that make them different from most companies. They follow a distinctive set of policies and practices to promote diversity and inclusion among employees.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   All video meetings have closed captioning, for workers who prefer to absorb information in text. Meeting agendas are distributed in advance so people who are uncomfortable speaking up can contribute in writing beforehand. Employees are asked daily for feedback, like whether they believe their strengths are valued and if they feel lonely at work.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''The whole idea is to create a safe space that allows everyone to be heard,'' Ms. Davila, 36, said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Ultranauts has been working for years on the challenges confronting so many companies during the pandemic, and probably beyond: how to effectively work remotely, make progress toward diversity and inclusion goals, and build a strong organizational culture.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The company, founded in 2013 by two former roommates at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has had a remote work force from Day 1. It was also founded to use the untapped talent of autistic people, who often think and process information differently from the rest of the population. Seventy-five percent of Ultranauts employees are on the autism spectrum.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   So the small start-up may offer lessons for corporate America in how to hire, manage and motivate far-flung employees, whose work and careers can suffer without the face time and hallway conversations of office life.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Ultranauts' purposeful construction of a workplace that really supports people is extraordinary,'' said Susanne Bruyere, academic director of the Yang-Tan Institute on Employment and Disability at Cornell University. ''Its techniques and tools could absolutely be applied more broadly.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The start-up's customers include big companies like AIG, BNY Mellon and Cigna. It began with manual quality testing of websites and apps but has steadily moved to more advanced work like data-quality engineering, data analytics and automated software testing.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   When the pandemic hit, Ultranauts, which is based in New York, lost business as a couple of large customers made cuts to conserve cash. But it quickly picked up new work from companies that are accelerating digital projects despite the downturn. The business now has 90 employees, up from 60 a year ago. Its goal is to expand to 200 in two years.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Ultranauts is backed by social-impact investors -- which seek financial returns, but not windfalls -- including The Disability Opportunity Fund, SustainVC, Wasabi Ventures and Moai Capital. They have invested $5.7 million so far.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The company insists its work force is a competitive advantage. The edge, it says, is not so much that autistic brains are wired for computing tasks but that people on the autism spectrum are a diverse group.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   One person may recognize patterns quickly, while another has a more measured cognitive style but arrives at different patterns and ways to fix code. The key lies in harnessing the varied talents of teams.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Meetings are recorded, transcribed and archived not only to accommodate workers who prefer reading to listening but also to foster a more open organization. That extends to the weekly meetings of the six-person leadership team at Ultranauts. The notes of those sessions, including the decisions made and reasons behind them, are published on the companywide Slack channel.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''It is a lot more transparency than most people in business are comfortable with,'' said Art Shectman, a co-founder and the company's president.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Ultranauts' leaders believe their style of wide-open, explicit communication -- no unwritten rules -- could benefit any company. Ultranauts is giving away a valued homegrown software product, Biodex, as part of a test to see how widely its tools and practices might take root in the corporate mainstream.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Each employee at Ultranauts has a Biodex profile that states the person's work, communication and feedback preferences. What is your typical response time to messages -- a few minutes, a few hours, same day? If a colleague has constructive criticism, how do you want to receive the feedback -- orally or in writing?
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Each morning, Biodex sends out a bot message with two questions: How ''interactive'' -- ready to communicate with others -- are you feeling today? What's your energy level today? Workers answer on a 1-to-10 scale.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Rajesh Anandan, a co-founder and the chief executive of Ultranauts, describes Biodex as ''a quick-start guide for how to work with a person.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Ultranauts is letting teams at about a dozen organizations, from big corporations to start-ups, try out a test version of Biodex. If trial runs with outsiders go well, Ultranauts plans to make Biodex a free download on the Slack app store by the end of the year. Other Ultranauts apps, like its program for polling worker sentiment and well-being, would follow.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''We've built an engine that unlocks opportunity for people who haven't had a fair shot before,'' Mr. Anandan said. ''But if we only do that for ourselves, it won't have much of an impact.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mr. Anandan is a former Bain consultant who switched gears and careers. In 2003, he went to work for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and later started an incubator for social ventures at UNICEF. Both he and Mr. Shectman, a software engineering consultant, had known since their M.I.T. days autistic people who struggled to find work.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Many autistic people do well with the structured coursework of school, earning undergraduate and graduate university degrees. But they often stumble at the first hurdle into the job market -- the traditional job interview. They tend to struggle with social interaction, speaking informally and reading the nonverbal cues of communication.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   That was the case for Leslie Reis. She holds a master's degree in software engineering, but had not had a full-time job until Ultranauts hired her last year.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Writing, Ms. Reis explained, is how she communicates best. ''For a lot of organizations, that was perceived as something that would be a drawback,'' she said in an email, ''rather than a way for me to participate more fully.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Ultranauts does not use work experience to filter job candidates. The company does conduct structured interviews, but hiring is largely based on skills assessments that it has developed to measure traits like the ability to work through new problems and take guidance and apply it. Work simulations are another test.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Tulco, an investment firm in Pittsburgh, hired Ultranauts this year to do data-quality work. Tulco invests in traditional businesses that it thinks can become more efficient and profitable by applying 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  and artificial intelligence, but creating those A.I. algorithms requires sifting through troves of messy data.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Ultranauts' work has impressed Matthew Marolda, executive vice president for 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  at Tulco. On one project, its team cleaned up and loaded a vast amount of information into an A.I. model with remarkable speed, days instead of weeks, he said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''This is a work force with inherent strengths,'' Mr. Marolda said. ''They're really good at pattern recognition and really good at detail work.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Seeking new pools of skilled workers, and prodded by advocacy groups, several companies in recent years have begun programs to recruit and employ autistic workers, including SAP, Microsoft, Ernst & Young and JPMorgan Chase.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Ultranauts is one of a handful of small companies and nonprofits in Europe and the United States that employ mainly autistic workers for jobs in technology. Others include Specialisterne, Auticon, Daivergent and Aspiritech. Ultranauts stands out, experts say, for working entirely remotely from the outset and for developing its carefully crafted combination of digital tools and workplace practices.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Its culture has certainly resonated with Ms. Davila, who is autistic and was hired four years ago, with no formal training in computing. Since then, she has mastered not only programming languages but also skills as a manager.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Ultranauts has also been her ladder to the middle class. ''Before I got the job at Ultranauts, I was on food stamps,'' Ms. Davila recalled. ''Now, I own my own house. And it's a nice house in a nice neighborhood.''

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Ultranauts has been developing creative ways to hire, manage and motivate a far-flung and diverse work force for seven years.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 From her home in Beaverton, Ore., Jamie Davila leads a team of eight engineers in seven states for the technology start-up Ultranauts. Like millions of other people during these work-from-home times, she relies on popular communication tools like Zoom and Slack.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 But Ms. Davila and Ultranauts also work remotely in ways that make them different from most companies. They follow a distinctive set of policies and practices to promote diversity and inclusion among employees.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 All video meetings have closed captioning, for workers who prefer to absorb information in text. Meeting agendas are distributed in advance so people who are uncomfortable speaking up can contribute in writing beforehand. Employees are asked daily for feedback, like whether they believe their strengths are valued and if they feel lonely at work.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93The whole idea is to create a safe space that allows everyone to be heard,\'94 Ms. Davila, 36, said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Ultranauts has been working for years on the challenges confronting so many companies during the pandemic, and probably beyond: how to effectively work remotely, make progress toward diversity and inclusion goals, and build a strong organizational culture.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The company, founded in 2013 by two former roommates at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has had a remote work force from Day 1. It was also founded to use the untapped talent of autistic people, who often think and process information differently from the rest of the population. Seventy-five percent of Ultranauts employees are on the autism spectrum.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 So the small start-up may offer lessons for corporate America in how to hire, manage and motivate far-flung employees, whose work and careers can suffer without the face time and hallway conversations of office life.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93Ultranauts\'92 purposeful construction of a workplace that really supports people is extraordinary,\'94 said Susanne Bruyere, academic director of the Yang-Tan Institute on Employment and Disability at Cornell University. \'93Its techniques and tools could absolutely be applied more broadly.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The start-up\'92s customers include big companies like AIG, BNY Mellon and Cigna. It began with manual quality testing of websites and apps but has steadily moved to more advanced work like data-quality engineering, data analytics and automated software testing.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 When the pandemic hit, Ultranauts, which is based in New York, lost business as a couple of large customers made cuts to conserve cash. But it quickly picked up new work from companies that are accelerating digital projects despite the downturn. The business now has 90 employees, up from 60 a year ago. Its goal is to expand to 200 in two years.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Ultranauts is backed by social-impact investors \'97 which seek financial returns, but not windfalls \'97 including The Disability Opportunity Fund, SustainVC, Wasabi Ventures and Moai Capital. They have invested $5.7 million so far.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The company insists its work force is a competitive advantage. The edge, it says, is not so much that autistic brains are wired for computing tasks but that people on the autism spectrum are a diverse group.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 One person may recognize patterns quickly, while another has a more measured cognitive style but arrives at different patterns and ways to fix code. The key lies in harnessing the varied talents of teams.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Meetings are recorded, transcribed and archived not only to accommodate workers who prefer reading to listening but also to foster a more open organization. That extends to the weekly meetings of the six-person leadership team at Ultranauts. The notes of those sessions, including the decisions made and reasons behind them, are published on the companywide Slack channel.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93It is a lot more transparency than most people in business are comfortable with,\'94 said Art Shectman, a co-founder and the company\'92s president.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Ultranauts\'92 leaders believe their style of wide-open, explicit communication \'97 no unwritten rules \'97 could benefit any company. Ultranauts is giving away a valued homegrown software product, Biodex, as part of a test to see how widely its tools and practices might take root in the corporate mainstream.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Each employee at Ultranauts has a Biodex profile that states the person\'92s work, communication and feedback preferences. What is your typical response time to messages \'97 a few minutes, a few hours, same day? If a colleague has constructive criticism, how do you want to receive the feedback \'97 orally or in writing?
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Each morning, Biodex sends out a bot message with two questions: How \'93interactive\'94 \'97 ready to communicate with others \'97 are you feeling today? What\'92s your energy level today? Workers answer on a 1-to-10 scale.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Rajesh Anandan, a co-founder and the chief executive of Ultranauts, describes Biodex as \'93a quick-start guide for how to work with a person.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Ultranauts is letting teams at about a dozen organizations, from big corporations to start-ups, try out a test version of Biodex. If trial runs with outsiders go well, Ultranauts plans to make Biodex a free download on the Slack app store by the end of the year. Other Ultranauts apps, like its program for polling worker sentiment and well-being, would follow.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93We\'92ve built an engine that unlocks opportunity for people who haven\'92t had a fair shot before,\'94 Mr. Anandan said. \'93But if we only do that for ourselves, it won\'92t have much of an impact.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Mr. Anandan is a former Bain consultant who switched gears and careers. In 2003, he went to work for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and later started an incubator for social ventures at UNICEF. Both he and Mr. Shectman, a software engineering consultant, had known since their M.I.T. days autistic people who struggled to find work.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Many autistic people do well with the structured coursework of school, earning undergraduate and graduate university degrees. But they often stumble at the first hurdle into the job market \'97 the traditional job interview. They tend to struggle with social interaction, speaking informally and reading the nonverbal cues of communication.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 That was the case for Leslie Reis. She holds a master\'92s degree in software engineering, but had not had a full-time job until Ultranauts hired her last year.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Writing, Ms. Reis explained, is how she communicates best. \'93For a lot of organizations, that was perceived as something that would be a drawback,\'94 she said in an email, \'93rather than a way for me to participate more fully.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Ultranauts does not use work experience to filter job candidates. The company does conduct structured interviews, but hiring is largely based on skills assessments that it has developed to measure traits like the ability to work through new problems and take guidance and apply it. Work simulations are another test.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Tulco, an investment firm in Pittsburgh, hired Ultranauts this year to do data-quality work. Tulco invests in traditional businesses that it thinks can become more efficient and profitable by applying 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  and artificial intelligence, but creating those A.I. algorithms requires sifting through troves of messy data.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Ultranauts\'92 work has impressed Matthew Marolda, executive vice president for 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  at Tulco. On one project, its team cleaned up and loaded a vast amount of information into an A.I. model with remarkable speed, days instead of weeks, he said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93This is a work force with inherent strengths,\'94 Mr. Marolda said. \'93They\'92re really good at pattern recognition and really good at detail work.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Seeking new pools of skilled workers, and prodded by advocacy groups, several companies in recent years have begun programs to recruit and employ autistic workers, including SAP, Microsoft, Ernst &amp; Young and JPMorgan Chase.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Ultranauts is one of a handful of small companies and nonprofits in Europe and the United States that employ mainly autistic workers for jobs in technology. Others include Specialisterne, Auticon, Daivergent and Aspiritech. Ultranauts stands out, experts say, for working entirely remotely from the outset and for developing its carefully crafted combination of digital tools and workplace practices.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Its culture has certainly resonated with Ms. Davila, who is autistic and was hired four years ago, with no formal training in computing. Since then, she has mastered not only programming languages but also skills as a manager.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Ultranauts has also been her ladder to the middle class. \'93Before I got the job at Ultranauts, I was on food stamps,\'94 Ms. Davila recalled. \'93Now, I own my own house. And it\'92s a nice house in a nice neighborhood.\'94

\f2\fs20 \cf0 In-person final exams were canceled for thousands of students this spring, so computers stepped in -- to disastrous effect.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Isabel Casta\'f1eda's first words were in Spanish. She spends every summer with relatives in Mexico. She speaks Spanish with her family at home. When her school, Westminster High in Colorado, closed for the pandemic in March, her Spanish literature class had just finished analyzing an entire novel in translation, Albert Camus's ''The Plague.'' She got a 5 out of 5 on her Advanced Placement Spanish exam last year, following two straight years of A+ grades in Spanish class. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   And yet, she failed her International Baccalaureate Spanish exam this year.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   When she got her final results, Ms. Casta\'f1eda was shocked. ''Everybody believed that I was going to score very high,'' she told me. ''Then, the scores came back and I didn't even score a passing grade. I scored well below passing.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   How did this happen? An algorithm assigned a grade to Ms. Casta\'f1eda and 160,000 other students. The International Baccalaureate -- a global program that awards a prestigious diploma to students in addition to the one they receive from their high schools -- canceled its usual in-person final exams because of the pandemic. Instead, it used an algorithm to ''predict'' students' grades, based on an array of student information, including teacher-estimated grades and past performance by students in each school.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Ms. Casta\'f1eda was not alone in receiving a surprising failing grade -- tens of thousands of International Baccalaureate students protested their computer-assigned grades online and in person. High-achieving, low-income students were hit particularly hard: many took the exams expecting to earn college credit with their scores and save thousands of dollars on tuition.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Nor was the International Baccalaureate the only organization to use a computer program to assign students grades amid the pandemic. The United Kingdom's in-person A-level exams, which help determine which universities students go to, were also canceled and replaced with grades-by-algorithm. Students who were denied university entrance because of these imaginary grades took to the streets, chanting anti-algorithm slogans. Only after an uproar did the government change course, though many students were left in limbo without university admission.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The lesson from these debacles is clear: Algorithms should not be used to assign student grades. And we should think much more critically about algorithmic decision-making overall, especially in education. The pandemic makes it tempting to imagine that social institutions like school can be replaced by technological solutions. They can't.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The bureaucrats who decided to use a computer to assign grades are guilty of a bias I call technochauvinism: the idea that technological solutions are superior. It's usually accompanied by equally bogus notions like, ''Computers make neutral decisions'' or, ''Computers are objective because their decisions are based on math.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Computers are excellent at doing math, but education is not math -- it's a social system. And algorithmic systems repeatedly fail at making social decisions. Algorithms can't monitor or detect hate speech, they can't replace social workers in public assistance programs, they can't predict crime, they can't determine which job applicants are more suited than others, they can't do effective facial recognition, and they can't grade essays or replace teachers.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   In the case of the International Baccalaureate program, grades could have been assigned based on the sample materials that students had already submitted by the time schools shut down. Instead, the organization decided to use an algorithm, which probably seemed like it would be cheaper and easier.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The process worked like this: Data scientists took student information and fed it into a computer. The computer then constructed a model that outputted individual student grades, which International Baccalaureate claimed the students would have gotten if they had taken the standardized tests that didn't happen. It's a legitimate 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  method, similar to the methods that predict which Netflix series you'll want to watch next or which deodorant you're likely to order from Amazon.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The problem is, 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  stinks at making predictions that are ethical or fair. In education, racial and class bias is baked into the system -- and an algorithm will only amplify those biases.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Crude generalizations work for Netflix predictions because the stakes are low. If the Netflix algorithm suggests a show and I don't like it, I ignore it and move on with my day. In education, the stakes are much higher. A transcript follows you for years; when I was 25 and well out of college, I applied for a job that asked for my SAT scores.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   In Ms. Casta\'f1eda's case, her failing grade was most likely due in part to the fact that historical performance data for her school was one of the inputs to the algorithm. The computer assumed that the students at Westminster, who are mostly low-income students of color, would continue to do poorly.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Everyone I know got downgraded one or two levels,'' Ms. Casta\'f1eda told me. ''It's not fair that our scores were brought down because of our school's history. It's unfair to punish students for where they live.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Another input to the algorithm was teacher prediction of the students' grades. Teachers tend to have lower expectations for Black and Brown students compared to white students; this bias is well known in the education community and ignored in the 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  community. Thus a very human bias prevailed in the computational system.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   International Baccalaureate and Ofqual, the agency that administers Britain's A-level exams, have reluctantly realized that algorithmic grades were a mistake. Since the outcry over algorithm-assigned grades, both organizations have been sued. Many students, including Ms. Casta\'f1eda, ended up receiving new, higher imaginary grades.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Roger Taylor, chair of the Ofqual board, apologized in front of a House of Commons educational oversight committee this week. ''We are sorry for what happened this summer,'' he said. ''With hindsight it appears unlikely that we could ever have delivered this policy successfully.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   As we stare down the fall semester online, there are going to be infinitely many technochauvinist calls to transform online education and use algorithmic tools that promise to evaluate individual student learning. Resist these calls.

\f2\fs20 Nor was the International Baccalaureate the only organization to use a computer program to assign students grades amid the pandemic. The United Kingdom\'92s in-person A-level exams, which help determine which universities students go to, were also canceled and replaced with 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 grades-by-algorithm
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone . Students who were denied university entrance because of these imaginary grades took to the streets, chanting anti-algorithm slogans. Only after an uproar did the government
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 change course
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , though many students were left in limbo without university admission.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The lesson from these debacles is clear: Algorithms should not be used to assign student grades. And we should think much more critically about algorithmic decision-making overall, especially in education. The pandemic makes it tempting to imagine that social institutions like school can be replaced by technological solutions. They can\'92t.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The bureaucrats who decided to use a computer to assign grades are guilty of a bias I call technochauvinism: the idea that technological solutions are superior. It\'92s usually accompanied by equally bogus notions like, \'93Computers make neutral decisions\'94 or, \'93Computers are objective because their decisions are based on math.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Computers are excellent at doing math, but education is not math \'97 it\'92s a social system. And algorithmic systems repeatedly fail at making social decisions. Algorithms can\'92t monitor or detect hate speech, they can\'92t replace social workers in public assistance programs, they can\'92t predict crime, they can\'92t determine which job applicants are more suited than others, they can\'92t do effective facial recognition, and they can\'92t grade essays or replace teachers.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In the case of the International Baccalaureate program, grades could have been assigned based on the sample materials that students had already submitted by the time schools shut down. Instead, the organization decided to use an algorithm, which probably seemed like it would be cheaper and easier.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The process worked like this: Data scientists took student information and fed it into a computer. The computer then constructed a model that outputted individual student grades, which International Baccalaureate claimed the students would have gotten if they had taken the standardized tests that didn\'92t happen. It\'92s a legitimate 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  method, similar to the methods that predict which Netflix series you\'92ll want to watch next or which deodorant you\'92re likely to order from Amazon.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The problem is, 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  stinks at making predictions that are ethical or fair. In education, racial and class bias is baked into the system \'97 and an algorithm will only amplify those biases.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Crude generalizations work for Netflix predictions because the stakes are low. If the Netflix algorithm suggests a show and I don\'92t like it, I ignore it and move on with my day. In education, the stakes are much higher. A transcript follows you for years; when I was 25 and well out of college, I applied for a job that asked for my SAT scores.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In Ms. Casta\'f1eda\'92s case, her failing grade was most likely due in part to the fact that historical performance data for her school was one of the inputs to the algorithm. The computer assumed that the students at Westminster, who are mostly low-income students of color, would continue to do poorly.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93Everyone I know got downgraded one or two levels,\'94 Ms. Casta\'f1eda told me. \'93It\'92s not fair that our scores were brought down because of our school\'92s history. It\'92s unfair to punish students for where they live.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Another input to the algorithm was teacher prediction of the students\'92 grades. Teachers tend to 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 have lower expectations
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  for Black and Brown students compared to white students; this bias is well known in the education community and ignored in the 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  community. Thus a very human bias prevailed in the computational system.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 International Baccalaureate and Ofqual, the agency that administers Britain\'92s A-level exams, have reluctantly realized that algorithmic grades were a mistake. Since the outcry over algorithm-assigned grades, both organizations have been sued. Many students, including Ms. Casta\'f1eda, ended up receiving new, higher imaginary grades.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Roger Taylor, chair of the Ofqual board, 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 apologized
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  in front of a House of Commons educational oversight committee this week. \'93We are sorry for what happened this summer,\'94 he said. \'93With hindsight it appears unlikely that we could ever have delivered this policy successfully.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \cf0 As we stare down the fall semester online, there are going to be infinitely many technochauvinist calls to transform online education and use algorithmic tools that promise to evaluate individual student learning. Resist these calls.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 A committee found that the athletic department broke an N.C.A.A. rule by revoking Henry Bazakas's summer scholarship. His fight to get it back showed the cutthroat side of college football.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Henry Bazakas embodied everything the University of California wants in a football player. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   A third-generation Cal student who grew up in Berkeley, Bazakas arrived on campus five years ago as a walk-on offensive lineman. Three times he earned an award for having the team's highest grade-point average. He and a teammate spearheaded a summer reading program at local elementary schools. He won another award, for his commitment to strength and conditioning while recovering from a torn knee ligament. And last season, after he finally earned an athletic scholarship, he started three games at left tackle.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   But none of that counted for much in June, when Bazakas called the Cal football coach, Justin Wilcox, to say that he was opting out of his final season because of health concerns related to the coronavirus pandemic.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The call was the beginning of an odyssey that illustrates the normally unseen, cutthroat side of the business of college football, with tensions that have been magnified for athletes by the determined push to play during the pandemic.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Nine days later, Bazakas found his scholarship had been cut off, and he was then billed more than $24,000 halfway through his summer term because the athletic department had revoked the financial aid that it had already paid.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The summer school aid was ultimately reinstated by a university appeals committee, which said the school had violated N.C.A.A. rules by abruptly pulling Bazakas's aid before giving him an opportunity for a hearing.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Bazakas also asked for his scholarship back for the fall semester, but the appeals panel sided with the athletic department's decision to not renew it. While most of his teammates arrived at Cal with scholarships pledged for four years, walk-ons, like Bazakas, who eventually earn scholarships may not get them in subsequent years, and Cal had met an N.C.A.A. deadline in July not to renew his.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''It feels like the second I was done playing football, the program was done with me,'' said Bazakas, who waited nearly three months for his summer aid to be restored through appeal.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Wilcox, the football coach, and Jay Larson, the senior associate athletic director who administers the football program and directed its arguments against Bazakas's appeal, declined interview requests about the case. Herb Benenson, an athletic department spokesman, said Bazakas knew that he had not been offered a scholarship for the 2020-21 academic year when he left the team.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   This is true, but only partly so. Bazakas had asked his coach several times over six months whether the scholarship would be renewed. He got no firm answer. Wilcox's decision came through an email from the financial aid office on June 25.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Benenson said the athletic department, even though it argued against Bazakas, agreed with the university's decision to restore the player's summer aid. Benenson said the aid was mistakenly canceled because of a clerical error that did not come to light until an inquiry by The New York Times in mid-October, a month after the committee's ruling.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Bazakas said neither Wilcox nor Larson, nor anyone else from Cal, had contacted him to acknowledge what Benenson characterized as ''an honest mistake.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   'All the power is in the coach's hands -- you can't negotiate,' a former teammate said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   As major college football has lurched through the pandemic in pursuit of billions in television revenue -- Cal had its first two scheduled games canceled, then lost Sunday to U.C.L.A. in a game arranged two days before kickoff -- not even mandated protections for players have been ironclad.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   In August, Washington State receiver Kassidy Woods, who opted out because he has the sickle cell trait, was allowed to keep his scholarship but removed from the team when Coach Nick Rolovich told Woods it would be ''an issue'' that he was aligned with a player rights' movement. Utah State Coach Gary Andersen, before he was fired after an 0-3 start, said there was a reason none of his players had opted out. ''It's not an option,'' he told reporters. ''If you opt out, you're not with us.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   As players weigh their health risks, an unstated pressure urges them to continue competing to maintain their places in the pecking order for playing time. For those who arrived as walk-ons, a missed season heightens the uncertainty about whether a scholarship will be renewed.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''The way we use our voice, how we play or practice -- that's what determines if we keep our scholarship,'' said Gabe Siemieniec, a former walk-on kicker at Cal who transferred to Louisiana Tech before the season in part because he was not sure whether his scholarship would be renewed. ''It's kind of interesting. All the power is in the coach's hands -- you can't negotiate.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Programs at the top level of college football may offer up to 85 football scholarships each year with the remainder of a 120-player roster filled by non-scholarship players, or walk-ons.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Walk-ons can be indispensable to even the best programs. In practices, they mimic opposing players to help the starters prepare for the next game. They often lift the team grade-point average and sometimes compensate for recruiting mistakes when they blossom into contributors. The patron saint of walk-ons is Hunter Renfrow, who caught a last-second touchdown to win the national championship for Clemson in 2017.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   For walk-ons, a scholarship is not just a financial reward.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   It is a stamp of legitimacy earned through sweat and sacrifice in the weight room and on the practice field, and through their play on Saturdays. Scholarships are often conferred in front of teammates in elaborate presentations, which the schools happily promote on social media.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   'You're supposed to make every decision for the team.'
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Bazakas recalled the immense pride he felt when Wilcox informed him that he would be on scholarship last year. Bazakas grew up sitting in the stands at Memorial Stadium rooting for Cal. His late grandfather, a Cal graduate, was a season-ticket holder. His father, a financial officer at a tech company, and his mother, an educator, graduated from Cal. His affinity runs so deep that he rejected his mother's suggestion that he apply to Cal's archrival, Stanford.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Though Bazakas -- who started playing football in high school -- drew interest from Ivy League schools and Weber State, he jumped at an offer from Sonny Dykes, then the coach at Cal, to join the Golden Bears as a walk-on.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''That was a dream come true,'' Bazakas said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Bazakas quickly realized how far he was from playing in a game. But he got stronger and improved his technique. By his third season, he had worked his way up to the 70-player travel squad. The next season was cut short by a torn knee ligament.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Last year, after being awarded a scholarship, Bazakas was thrust into the conference opener because of a teammate's injury and helped the team drive the length of the field for a late field goal to beat Washington. He started three games and also played in a victory over Stanford that ended Cal's eight-game losing streak in the rivalry.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''It was my proudest moment,'' Bazakas said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Bazakas had hoped for more highlights this season. He wanted to compete for a starting position. But he is grateful for the experiences he has had.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''I didn't want it to end the way it did, but in the scale of 2020, most things aren't going the way people wanted them to go,'' Bazakas said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Bazakas opted out at a moment of great uncertainty for college football players. Some schools were requiring athletes to sign liability waivers upon returning to campus for summer workouts, and it was weeks before conferences like the Big Ten, the Pac-12 and the Southeastern Conferences said they would honor scholarships for athletes who opted out. The N.C.A.A. did not make it a blanket policy until August. (The standard scholarship agreement says that athletes can have their aid canceled if they withdraw from a team.)
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''You're supposed to make every decision for the team and that's what you want, but at some point, you're an individual,'' Bazakas said. ''You're not really allowed to advocate for yourself. You don't realize you can until you're out of the system.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Around the time Bazakas opted out, two close friends on the team -- offensive linemen Valentino Daltoso and Jake Curhan -- were at the center of a movement by Pac-12 players that pushed for more rights for players, including say on health protocols and protections for athletes who chose to sit out a season.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Andrew Cooper, who ran cross-country at Washington State and Cal and has been an organizer in the athletes' rights movement, said Bazakas's case was one of many that were discussed as hundreds of players around the country had group conversations over the summer through videoconferencing. (Daltoso and Curhan did not respond to interview requests.)
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Ninety-nine percent of college athletes stay silent about the injustices they experience,'' Cooper said. ''We're told, 'Just be grateful.''' He added: ''When it comes down to it, no one is there to protect us, because athletic departments' financial interests do not align with athletes' interests.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The pandemic upended the best chance for walk-ons to earn their scholarships anew.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Bazakas was among six walk-ons who received scholarships last season and were eligible to return in 2020. Wilcox made it clear that the aid was for one year and that subsequent years could be awarded if Cal had scholarships available.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Two of those players were certain to have their scholarships renewed because of their strong play. Shortly after last season ended, the four others were called into Wilcox's office, one by one, and left with a similar impression: that their aid was very much uncertain for the next season. Some of their spots, for example, could be taken by transfers who would fill more urgent needs.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The former walk-ons viewed spring practices as their best chance to prove to the coaches they deserved to have their scholarships renewed. But after four sessions, football was shut down because of the virus.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Everything was up in the air,'' Siemieniec said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The three other players besides Bazakas entered the transfer portal to seek scholarship offers elsewhere. Two transferred, and one, tight end Collin Moore, had his scholarship renewed.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Bazakas, though, was already deep into a master's program for information and 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone , so leaving did not make sense.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   But by June, as teams planned for summer workouts, Bazakas began to question whether returning to campus was a good idea.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Bazakas, who stands 6-foot-6, weighed 330 pounds at the time, putting him in a high-risk category if he contracted the virus. His parents are in their 50s, so they could be vulnerable, too. He worried about catching the virus while working out with his teammates, then bringing it home or to people in his neighborhood.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''The thought of going back scared me a lot,'' said Bazakas, who had repeated conversations with his teammates, his girlfriend and his family over several months.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Finally, on June 16, the day before Cal announced players could return to campus to prepare for voluntary workouts, Bazakas called Wilcox.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''He was pretty understanding,'' Bazakas said. ''He said the world is crazy and everyone has to make a choice. He asked, 'Is there a chance I can talk you out of this or have you made up your mind?' I told him I had made up my mind. He said, 'OK, I respect that.' It wasn't a long conversation.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Bazakas said his scholarship was not discussed.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   'Man, I'm going to have to explain this to my parents.'
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   When he called his coach, Bazakas did not know about the key date of July 1, when the N.C.A.A. requires schools to notify athletes of any roster reduction for the next academic year. The date was not mentioned in the financial aid agreement that Bazakas signed for 2019-20. Benenson, the athletic department spokesman, acknowledged that Bazakas had not been notified of Cal's deadline, but he said Wilcox had told the player not to expect a renewal.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   As for summer aid, each school makes its own decisions. This summer Cal tightened its financial belt. The athletic department, which was facing a $55 million deficit if there were no fall sports, largely restricted athletes to one summer class because of virus-related budget constraints, Benenson said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Bazakas appeared to be an exception. He received a text on May 18 from Joel Derechinsky, the team's academic coordinator, who asked if Bazakas needed to take all three classes he had registered for during the summer semester.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Bazakas, who earned his bachelor's degree in business administration, replied that he wanted to leave his final two classes for the fall semester during the season. Derechinsky said that would be OK. (Derechinsky declined to be interviewed.)
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   A month later, Bazakas received notice that he would no longer be on scholarship. One night as he considered whether to appeal, Bazakas checked his student account portal before he went to bed.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   He blinked.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   It carried two new charges on July 1: $23,506 for summer fees and $631 for the summer stipend. ''I was pretty shook,'' Bazakas said. ''I thought, 'Man, I'm going to have to explain this to my parents.'''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   As September approached, Bazakas filed the final paperwork in his appeal with the help of several family friends, including a lawyer.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The athletic department countered Bazakas's plea for restoring his summer aid by offering part of it back. Larson, in a Sept. 3 letter to the appeals committee, wrote: ''Although we are not required to do so by NCAA rules, we have decided to provide summer aid to cover tuition and fees for one of Mr. Bazakas' courses.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The three-person committee sided with Bazakas. It said the athletic department failed to provide a hearing before his aid was revoked, which is required by N.C.A.A. rules.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   But Bob Jacobsen, an undergraduate dean who was on the committee, said Bazakas's summer aid was restored because Cal's policy does not allow aid to be revoked during a term. When asked why that was not written in the ruling, he said: ''This is not a Supreme Court decision where we have to cite it. If the document doesn't make sense as a public relations document, so be it.'' He added: ''We didn't expect anybody would be reading it.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Benenson said the athletic department learned more recently that its error occurred because Bazakas's courses were incorrectly classified as beginning in late July rather than in May.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The case for a fall scholarship, Bazakas knew, was more difficult to make. He is spending $15,000 to take his last two classes and he will graduate in December.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''I understand the business of football -- if you don't need a lineman as bad as you need a receiver and you take it away,'' Bazakas said of the scholarship. ''But I never got an answer; I never heard a yes or no. When I talked to Coach Wilcox the last time, I said if I hadn't stepped away, would I have still gotten my aid? He didn't answer.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   He added: ''That's the biggest what-if. If I hadn't opted out, what would have happened?''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Bazakas -- who signed off on his appeal letters with ''Go Bears!'' -- said his experience had not soured him on Cal. He has followed the myriad twists his old teammates have endured -- in August the Pac-12 postponed football, only to later decide to play after all, albeit with a truncated schedule. Practices have been interrupted and schedules upended. He feels for his teammates.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Last weekend Bazakas -- 50 pounds lighter, having shed some of his football girth -- sat in front of the TV and did what he had always done. He rooted for the Bears to win.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 A committee found that the athletic department broke an N.C.A.A. rule by revoking Henry Bazakas\'92s summer scholarship. His fight to get it back showed the cutthroat side of college football.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f4\i\fs20 \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Henry Bazakas
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  embodied everything the University of California wants in a football player.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 A third-generation Cal student who grew up in Berkeley, Bazakas arrived on campus five years ago as a walk-on offensive lineman. Three times he earned an award for having the team\'92s highest grade-point average. He and a teammate spearheaded a summer reading program at local elementary schools. He won another award, for his commitment to strength and conditioning while recovering from a torn knee ligament. And last season, after he finally earned an athletic scholarship, he started three games at left tackle.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 But none of that counted for much in June, when Bazakas called the Cal football coach, Justin Wilcox, to say that he was opting out of his final season because of health concerns related to 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 the coronavirus pandemic
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone .
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The call was the beginning of an odyssey that illustrates the normally unseen, cutthroat side of the business of college football, with tensions that have been magnified for athletes by the determined push to play during the pandemic.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Nine days later, Bazakas found his scholarship had been cut off, and he was then billed more than $24,000 halfway through his summer term because the athletic department had revoked the financial aid that it had already paid.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The summer school aid was ultimately reinstated by a university appeals committee, which said the school had violated N.C.A.A. rules by abruptly pulling Bazakas\'92s aid before giving him an opportunity for a hearing.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Bazakas also asked for his scholarship back for the fall semester, but the appeals panel sided with the athletic department\'92s decision to not renew it. While most of his teammates arrived at Cal with scholarships pledged for four years, walk-ons, like Bazakas, who eventually earn scholarships may not get them in subsequent years, and Cal had met an N.C.A.A. deadline in July not to renew his.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93It feels like the second I was done playing football, the program was done with me,\'94 said Bazakas, who waited nearly three months for his summer aid to be restored through appeal.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Wilcox, the football coach, and Jay Larson, the senior associate athletic director who administers the football program and directed its arguments against Bazakas\'92s appeal, declined interview requests about the case. Herb Benenson, an athletic department spokesman, said Bazakas knew that he had not been offered a scholarship for the 2020-21 academic year when he left the team.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This is true, but only partly so. Bazakas had asked his coach several times over six months whether the scholarship would be renewed. He got no firm answer. Wilcox\'92s decision came through an email from the financial aid office on June 25.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Benenson said the athletic department, even though it argued against Bazakas, agreed with the university\'92s decision to restore the player\'92s summer aid. Benenson said the aid was mistakenly canceled because of a clerical error that did not come to light until an inquiry by The New York Times in mid-October, a month after the committee\'92s ruling.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Bazakas said neither Wilcox nor Larson, nor anyone else from Cal, had contacted him to acknowledge what Benenson characterized as \'93an honest mistake.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'91All the power is in the coach\'92s hands \'97 you can\'92t negotiate,\'92 a former teammate said.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 As major college football has lurched through the pandemic in pursuit of billions in television revenue \'97 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Cal had its first two scheduled games canceled
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , then lost Sunday to U.C.L.A. in a game arranged two days before kickoff \'97 not even mandated protections for players have been ironclad.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In August, 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Washington State receiver Kassidy Woods
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , who opted out because he has the sickle cell trait, was allowed to keep his scholarship but removed from the team when Coach Nick Rolovich told Woods it would be \'93an issue\'94 that he was aligned with a player rights\'92 movement. Utah State Coach Gary Andersen, before he was fired after an 0-3 start, said there was a reason none of his players had opted out. \'93It\'92s not an option,\'94 he told reporters. \'93If you opt out, you\'92re not with us.\'94
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 As players weigh their health risks, an unstated pressure urges them to continue competing to maintain their places in the pecking order for playing time. For those who arrived as walk-ons, a missed season heightens the uncertainty about whether a scholarship will be renewed.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93The way we use our voice, how we play or practice \'97 that\'92s what determines if we keep our scholarship,\'94 said Gabe Siemieniec, a former walk-on kicker at Cal who transferred to Louisiana Tech before the season in part because he was not sure whether his scholarship would be renewed. \'93It\'92s kind of interesting. All the power is in the coach\'92s hands \'97 you can\'92t negotiate.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Programs at the top level of college football may offer up to 85 football scholarships each year with the remainder of a 120-player roster filled by non-scholarship players, or walk-ons.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Walk-ons can be indispensable to even the best programs. In practices, they mimic opposing players to help the starters prepare for the next game. They often lift the team grade-point average and sometimes compensate for recruiting mistakes when they blossom into contributors. The patron saint of walk-ons is Hunter Renfrow, who 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 caught a last-second touchdown to win the national championship for Clemson in 2017
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone .
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 For walk-ons, a scholarship is not just a financial reward.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 It is a stamp of legitimacy earned through sweat and sacrifice in the weight room and on the practice field, and through their play on Saturdays. Scholarships are often conferred in front of teammates in elaborate presentations, 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 which the schools happily promote on social media
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone .
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 \'91You\'92re supposed to make every decision for the team.\'92
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Bazakas recalled the immense pride he felt when Wilcox informed him that he would be on scholarship last year. Bazakas grew up sitting in the stands at Memorial Stadium rooting for Cal. His late grandfather, a Cal graduate, was a season-ticket holder. His father, a financial officer at a tech company, and his mother, an educator, graduated from Cal. His affinity runs so deep that he rejected his mother\'92s suggestion that he apply to Cal\'92s archrival, Stanford.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Though Bazakas \'97 who started playing football in high school \'97 drew interest from Ivy League schools and Weber State, he jumped at an offer from Sonny Dykes, then the coach at Cal, to join the Golden Bears as a walk-on.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93That was a dream come true,\'94 Bazakas said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Bazakas quickly realized how far he was from playing in a game. But he got stronger and improved his technique. By his third season, he had worked his way up to the 70-player travel squad. The next season was cut short by a torn knee ligament.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Last year, after being awarded a scholarship, Bazakas was thrust into the conference opener because of a teammate\'92s injury and helped the team drive the length of the field for a late field goal to beat Washington. He started three games and also played in a victory over Stanford that ended Cal\'92s eight-game losing streak in the rivalry.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93It was my proudest moment,\'94 Bazakas said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Bazakas had hoped for more highlights this season. He wanted to compete for a starting position. But he is grateful for the experiences he has had.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93I didn\'92t want it to end the way it did, but in the scale of 2020, most things aren\'92t going the way people wanted them to go,\'94 Bazakas said.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Bazakas opted out at a moment of great uncertainty for college football players. 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Some schools were requiring athletes to sign liability waivers
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  upon returning to campus for summer workouts, and it was weeks before conferences like the Big Ten, the Pac-12 and the Southeastern Conferences said they would honor scholarships for athletes who opted out. The N.C.A.A. did not make it a blanket policy until August. (The standard scholarship agreement says that athletes can have their aid canceled if they withdraw from a team.)
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 \'93You\'92re supposed to make every decision for the team and that\'92s what you want, but at some point, you\'92re an individual,\'94 Bazakas said. \'93You\'92re not really allowed to advocate for yourself. You don\'92t realize you can until you\'92re out of the system.\'94
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Around the time Bazakas opted out, two close friends on the team \'97 offensive linemen Valentino Daltoso and Jake Curhan \'97 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 were at the center of a movement by Pac-12 players
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  that 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 pushed for more rights for players
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , including say on health protocols and protections for athletes who chose to sit out a season.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Andrew Cooper, who ran cross-country at Washington State and Cal and has been an organizer in the athletes\'92 rights movement, said Bazakas\'92s case was one of many that were discussed as hundreds of players around the country had group conversations over the summer through videoconferencing. (Daltoso and Curhan did not respond to interview requests.)
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93Ninety-nine percent of college athletes stay silent about the injustices they experience,\'94 Cooper said. \'93We\'92re told, \'91Just be grateful.\'92\'94 He added: \'93When it comes down to it, no one is there to protect us, because athletic departments\'92 financial interests do not align with athletes\'92 interests.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The pandemic upended the best chance for walk-ons to earn their scholarships anew.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Bazakas was among six walk-ons who received scholarships last season and were eligible to return in 2020. Wilcox made it clear that the aid was for one year and that subsequent years could be awarded if Cal had scholarships available.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Two of those players were certain to have their scholarships renewed because of their strong play. Shortly after last season ended, the four others were called into Wilcox\'92s office, one by one, and left with a similar impression: that their aid was very much uncertain for the next season. Some of their spots, for example, could be taken by transfers who would fill more urgent needs.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The former walk-ons viewed spring practices as their best chance to prove to the coaches they deserved to have their scholarships renewed. But after four sessions, football was shut down because of the virus.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93Everything was up in the air,\'94 Siemieniec said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The three other players besides Bazakas entered the transfer portal to seek scholarship offers elsewhere. Two transferred, and one, tight end Collin Moore, had his scholarship renewed.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Bazakas, though, was already deep into a master\'92s program for information and 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone , so leaving did not make sense.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 But by June, as teams planned for summer workouts, Bazakas began to question whether returning to campus was a good idea.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Bazakas, who stands 6-foot-6, weighed 330 pounds at the time, putting him in a high-risk category if he contracted the virus. His parents are in their 50s, so they could be vulnerable, too. He worried about catching the virus while working out with his teammates, then bringing it home or to people in his neighborhood.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93The thought of going back scared me a lot,\'94 said Bazakas, who had repeated conversations with his teammates, his girlfriend and his family over several months.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Finally, on June 16, the day before Cal announced players could return to campus to prepare for voluntary workouts, Bazakas called Wilcox.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93He was pretty understanding,\'94 Bazakas said. \'93He said the world is crazy and everyone has to make a choice. He asked, \'91Is there a chance I can talk you out of this or have you made up your mind?\'92 I told him I had made up my mind. He said, \'91OK, I respect that.\'92 It wasn\'92t a long conversation.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Bazakas said his scholarship was not discussed.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'91Man, I\'92m going to have to explain this to my parents.\'92
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 When he called his coach, Bazakas did not know about the key date of July 1, when the N.C.A.A. requires schools to notify athletes of any roster reduction for the next academic year. The date was not mentioned in the financial aid agreement that Bazakas signed for 2019-20. Benenson, the athletic department spokesman, acknowledged that Bazakas had not been notified of Cal\'92s deadline, but he said Wilcox had told the player not to expect a renewal.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 As for summer aid, each school makes its own decisions. This summer Cal tightened its financial belt. The athletic department, 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 which was facing a $55 million deficit
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  if there were no fall sports, largely restricted athletes to one summer class because of virus-related budget constraints, Benenson said.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Bazakas appeared to be an exception. He received a text on May 18 from Joel Derechinsky, the team\'92s academic coordinator, who asked if Bazakas needed to take all three classes he had registered for during the summer semester.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Bazakas, who earned his bachelor\'92s degree in business administration, replied that he wanted to leave his final two classes for the fall semester during the season. Derechinsky said that would be OK. (Derechinsky declined to be interviewed.)
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 A month later, Bazakas received notice that he would no longer be on scholarship. One night as he considered whether to appeal, Bazakas checked his student account portal before he went to bed.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 He blinked.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It carried two new charges on July 1: $23,506 for summer fees and $631 for the summer stipend. \'93I was pretty shook,\'94 Bazakas said. \'93I thought, \'91Man, I\'92m going to have to explain this to my parents.\'92\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 As September approached, Bazakas filed the final paperwork in his appeal with the help of several family friends, including a lawyer.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The athletic department countered Bazakas\'92s plea for restoring his summer aid by offering part of it back. Larson, in a Sept. 3 letter to the appeals committee, wrote: \'93Although we are not required to do so by NCAA rules, we have decided to provide summer aid to cover tuition and fees for one of Mr. Bazakas\'92 courses.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The three-person committee sided with Bazakas. It said the athletic department failed to provide a hearing before his aid was revoked, which is required by N.C.A.A. rules.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 But Bob Jacobsen, an undergraduate dean who was on the committee, said Bazakas\'92s summer aid was restored because Cal\'92s policy does not allow aid to be revoked during a term. When asked why that was not written in the ruling, he said: \'93This is not a Supreme Court decision where we have to cite it. If the document doesn\'92t make sense as a public relations document, so be it.\'94 He added: \'93We didn\'92t expect anybody would be reading it.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Benenson said the athletic department learned more recently that its error occurred because Bazakas\'92s courses were incorrectly classified as beginning in late July rather than in May.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The case for a fall scholarship, Bazakas knew, was more difficult to make. He is spending $15,000 to take his last two classes and he will graduate in December.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93I understand the business of football \'97 if you don\'92t need a lineman as bad as you need a receiver and you take it away,\'94 Bazakas said of the scholarship. \'93But I never got an answer; I never heard a yes or no. When I talked to Coach Wilcox the last time, I said if I hadn\'92t stepped away, would I have still gotten my aid? He didn\'92t answer.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 He added: \'93That\'92s the biggest what-if. If I hadn\'92t opted out, what would have happened?\'94
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Bazakas \'97 who signed off on his appeal letters with \'93Go Bears!\'94 \'97 said his experience had not soured him on Cal. He has followed the myriad twists his old teammates have endured \'97 in August 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 the Pac-12 postponed football
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , only to later decide to play after all, albeit with a truncated schedule. Practices have been interrupted and schedules upended. He feels for his teammates.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Last weekend Bazakas \'97 50 pounds lighter, having shed some of his football girth \'97 sat in front of the TV and did what he had always done. He rooted for the Bears to win.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 George Mahoney is an efficiency expert by trade and by nature. He's also among the analytics-minded coaches trying to bring data to one of the last holdouts in American sports -- high school football.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 MIDDLETOWN, N.J. -- The Mater Dei Prep Seraphs faced fourth-and-6 from the Middletown South 40-yard line in a scoreless October game with about four minutes left in the first quarter. Their coach, Dino Mangiero, encountered a pretty standard decision: Go for it or punt? 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   His headset crackled.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The voice on the other end belonged to a Columbia University graduate perched atop the school's tiny press box: George Mahoney, who doesn't have an official title on Mater Dei's staff or attend every practice, but who, in many ways, represents the early glimmers of what could be the future of high school football. A chemical engineer with 19 years of coaching experience and an affinity for innovative thinking, Mahoney serves as the analytics arm of Mater Dei's football operation.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   That very term, ''analytics'' -- which refers to the use of data analysis to inform decision-making -- has polarized big-money sports, pitting adherents against traditionalists in a zero-sum feud. A recent, prominent example of advanced metrics' sway over game decisions, when Tampa Bay Rays Manager Kevin Cash pulled his starting pitcher, Blake Snell, in Game 6 of the World Series last month, renewed the longstanding debate.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The hidebound sport of football has been slower than most to accept the findings of the data army, with longtime coaches and executives generally distrustful of those who didn't play at a high level. But that is changing. In N.F.L. and college programs, some more than others, the growing influence of 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  has reshaped everything from roster construction to asset management, elements of football dogma that might have seemed untouchable even five years ago.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Still, one area remains off-limits to analytics: N.C.A.A. and pro teams are prohibited from using computers to guide in-game tactics and must depend on static reports to make strategy calls. A small number of high schools, though, like Mater Dei, can, and do, use decision-making aids in real time.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   On that afternoon last month, Mahoney, 42, on his tablet computer, consulted prescriptive analytical software called EdjVarsity, a new tool in his arsenal. It simulates hundreds of thousands of games to determine which in-game decisions improve a team's likelihood of winning. He had spent more than a decade trying to penetrate high school football with statistical analysis, finding the culture of community and tradition nearly impermeable until he massaged his pitch. Now, he is testing the risk tolerance of a middle-class Catholic school that has reached the state championship in New Jersey in each of the past four years.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mahoney entered basic details of that first-quarter drive -- score, time, field position, down and distance -- and out came a bar graph at the bottom of his screen totaling the win probability to be gained by going for it on fourth down in one-yard increments: fourth-and-1, fourth-and-2 and so on.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   He relayed his recommendation to the coach, as he always does, balancing his radical approach with the stakes for Mater Dei's season. ''You don't want to be in the position where you're this analytics guy,'' Mahoney said, ''and you're blowing it for these guys that are legitimately calling X's and O's and working with these kids all year.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Tripping Over the Truth
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   As an agent of change, Mahoney acts deliberately. He knows Mangiero has a threshold for aggressiveness, so he doesn't push him beyond his comfort level. Instead, Mahoney relies on data to make other coaches, as he puts it, trip over the truth -- and Mangiero trusts him.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''He could be anything,'' Mangiero said, referring to a job title. ''The assistant head coach for analytics? Whatever George wants.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   They have known each other for more than 25 years, since Mangiero, 61, a former N.F.L. defensive lineman who is in his fifth season at Mater Dei, coached him at St. Joseph by-the-Sea High School on Staten Island. When he pondered in September adding someone to manage analytics, Mangiero didn't hesitate. He called Mahoney.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   For Mahoney, 5-foot-8 and a brawny 185 pounds, chasing efficiency is the through line connecting his personal and professional pursuits. It has been an obsession since childhood, when he would accompany his father, George, on calls to repair heating and air-conditioning units. Sitting in traffic, Mahoney would lament the time squandered that he could have been playing with friends.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   He walked onto the team at Columbia, where he obtained degrees in chemical engineering and mathematics, and then managed to manipulate his work schedule to allow him to coach.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The first time he worked under Mangiero, in 2008, as the special-teams coach at Poly Prep in Brooklyn, Mahoney was frustrated. Not with his boss but with preparing for an opponent that, after it scored, would occasionally bypass kicking deep for an onside kick. The threat consumed him all week and then into the off-season, when he wondered whether data supported the risky play.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Poring over statistics he had collected, Mahoney discovered that, yes, it made sense. But he also divined some unexpected special-teams trends. Namely, if 70 percent of punts were either fumbled or not caught at all, then what's the point in sending out a punt returner?
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''I kept looking at the data and hoping I was wrong,'' he said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mahoney considers this experience formative in his path to enlightenment. It fueled his interest in later projects, such as trying to quantify the correlation between offensive penalties and scoring drives. But his initial resistance also embodied the risk-averse culture so prevalent in football, where convention is doctrine. Especially in the high school realm, where a certain intimacy exists among town and team and sport.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''If a decision doesn't go well, you're going to hear it walking the school halls,'' said Adam Clack, the coach at Milton High School, north of Atlanta, one of the top Class 6A teams in Georgia. He is using EdjVarsity for a second consecutive season. ''You're going to hear it from the parents who have your phone number and aren't afraid to give you a call.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mahoney was so curious about the challenge of securing community support in that climate that in 2016 he flew to Arkansas to visit another contrarian with a zeal for statistical analysis, Kevin Kelley, who felt like an outcast 17 years ago when he pioneered a no-punt philosophy that has propelled his Pulaski Academy team to eight state titles.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''People want to know why -- they really, really do -- and as long as you've got a great reason,'' Kelley said, ''they're willing to at least accept it.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   When Mahoney was promoted to head coach at St. Peter's Boys High School, on Staten Island, in 2018, he reflected on that advice in his introductory speech to parents. Showing a video of two wildebeests standing backside to backside, Mahoney explained that if lions surrounded them, the wildebeests could swing around and protect each other. But if one strayed, the lions could eat them both.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''If you guys stick with us, we'll be OK,'' Mahoney said he told the parents. ''But the second one of you complains that we're not punting, or we onside kick, now you've exposed ourselves to the lions.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   At St. Peter's, he shortened and streamlined practices to keep players and coaches fresh. By never punting, they could devote more time to offense and defense. He applied the Pareto principle, also known as the 80-20 rule: By focusing on the 20 percent of plays that the opposition ran 80 percent of the time, he eliminated unnecessary film study. Since players weren't running downfield to smash the wedge on kickoffs, their risk of injury was diminished -- not a single concussion, he said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   To offset a disadvantage in talent, Mahoney felt St. Peter's had to play differently to compete, and indeed, games there doubled as a veritable advanced-stats carnival: The team used onside kicks, rarely deployed punt returners and went for it at counterintuitive times. Behaving in the extreme, he said, felt like the Spanish conquistador Hern\'e1n Cort\'e9s, who attacked Native Mexicans in 1519 with a small force and, to ensure his troops wouldn't retreat, ordered them to burn the boats they came on. Assistants who didn't agree with Mahoney quit.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   St. Peter's was 5-8 under Mahoney, but the record bothered members of the community less than the image the team projected. Fans booed when the team recovered onside kicks. In citing reasons for Mahoney's dismissal, the principal, Michael Cosentino, mentioned analytics but also said the team wasn't as physical or conditioned as he wanted.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''It didn't seem like we were putting our kids in the right position to win football games,'' Cosentino said. ''Certain things looked good on paper but don't really translate sometimes to the game. When you're dealing with individuals, they're not just numbers, our kids.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Scaling back, Mahoney said, would have felt like a betrayal of his values. But getting fired in the middle of the season still crushed his ego. In the aftermath, he wrote a 12-page treatise assessing his tenure. He attended the Sloan Sports Analytics Conference at M.I.T. and corresponded with Daniel Stern, an analyst with the Baltimore Ravens, one of the more analytics-savvy organizations in the N.F.L.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   As time passed, Mahoney grew ever more confident in his philosophy. It was his presentation that needed refining.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Most people in the world, they've never won an argument with statistics,'' Mahoney said. ''To change conventional wisdom, you usually need a good story.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   And when Mangiero called, in early September, Mahoney had one.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The New Guy With the Tablet
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   In his first few weeks at Mater Dei, Mahoney felt like an outsider. He worked with the specialists, but mainly, he observed, trying to negotiate his place. He wasn't sure how the other assistants perceived someone, even with his football background, coming in to oversee analytics, and he found it difficult, at first, to form relationships or read their expressions beneath their masks.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   On a staff that skews younger, Mahoney's arrival was met with enthusiasm but also some skepticism -- mostly, Mangiero said, from older coaches. But Mahoney had an ally in Mangiero, who said he had been interested in fourth-down aggressiveness since 2009, when New England went for it on fourth-and-2 from its own 28 late in the fourth quarter against Indianapolis -- and failed. Intrigued, Mangiero peppered his former player Brian Flores, then a Patriots assistant (and now the Miami Dolphins' coach), about Coach Bill Belichick's tactics.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   And when the Ravens excelled last season on fourth down, Mangiero went to a game in Baltimore -- his friend Joe Cullen is an assistant there -- and discussed their methodology afterward with Coach John Harbaugh.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   From Mahoney, Mangiero had heard about EdjVarsity, and asked him to use it to research whether Mater Dei should adjust its punting strategy. Breaking down the Seraphs' 27-25 loss in last season's state championship, he told Mangiero a story. On a video chat, Mahoney showed him a presentation detailing how certain decisions affected win probability.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''This whole thing is connected,'' Mahoney told him. ''All this stuff is chapters of a book. Let's put the chapters together and write the whole book.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Impressed, Mangiero, the next day, authorized investing $1,500 to buy an EdjVarsity yearly subscription. To acclimate himself, Mahoney would play an old edition of the Madden video game on simulation mode, pausing after each play to enter the updated details of the game.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Every week, as Mater Dei has tripped over the truth, Mahoney's responsibilities have expanded. He now manages the clock and advises on 2-point conversion strategy. He communicates the fourth-down plan, based on the tablet readouts, early in the series to guide how Mangiero and the offensive coordinator, Taylor Groh, call plays.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   If on third-and-7, for example, Groh knows that Mater Dei will be going for it on fourth-and-3 or less, he might call a play that could net 4 or 5 yards instead of trying to gain all 7 at once.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   During the week, after synthesizing customized postgame reports, Mahoney prepares a slide show presentation for the coaching staff. One was so illuminating, Mangiero said, he showed it to the team as part of a larger message about precision.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   By demonstrating that turnovers cost the Seraphs 15.5 percent in win probability in their previous game, he reframed the importance of ball security in more urgent terms. When someone jumps offsides in practice, Mangiero reinforced his point by saying the offender cost them a touchdown.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mahoney marvels at how quickly Mater Dei has incorporated analytics, and to its advantage: The Seraphs (4-1) have won four consecutive games heading into Friday's season finale and are positioned to earn a playoff berth.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   He wants to continue bridging the gap between science and 150 years of football. He wants to educate coaches without demanding they conform. He wants to research and experiment, build templates and confidence. He also wants to be a head coach again, and to train an acolyte or two.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Until then, he will appreciate giving Mater Dei an edge, as he did against Middletown South.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   As the final seconds ticked down in the Seraphs' 10-3 victory, Mahoney bumped fists with the assistants flanking him. He grabbed his Columbia laptop bag -- ''I need to bring the nerd side of me to football games'' -- and his headset. One by one, they headed down the stairs, toward the field, to their team, to celebrate together.

\f2\fs20 MIDDLETOWN, N.J. \'97 The Mater Dei Prep Seraphs faced fourth-and-6 from the Middletown South 40-yard line in a scoreless October game with about four minutes left in the first quarter. Their coach, Dino Mangiero, encountered a pretty standard decision: Go for it or punt?

A chemical engineer with 19 years of coaching experience and an affinity for innovative thinking, Mahoney serves as the analytics arm of Mater Dei\'92s football operation.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 That very term, \'93analytics\'94 \'97 which refers to the use of data analysis to inform decision-making \'97 has polarized big-money sports, pitting adherents against traditionalists in a zero-sum feud.

A small number of high schools, though, like Mater Dei, can, and do, use decision-making aids in real time.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 On that afternoon last month, Mahoney, 42, on his tablet computer, consulted prescriptive analytical software called EdjVarsity, a new tool in his arsenal. It simulates hundreds of thousands of games to determine which in-game decisions improve a team\'92s likelihood of winning. He had spent more than a decade trying to penetrate high school football with statistical analysis, finding the culture of community and tradition nearly impermeable until he massaged his pitch. Now, he is testing the risk tolerance of a middle-class Catholic school that has reached the state championship in New Jersey in each of the past four years.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Mahoney entered basic details of that first-quarter drive \'97 score, time, field position, down and distance \'97 and out came a bar graph at the bottom of his screen totaling the win probability to be gained by going for it on fourth down in one-yard increments: fourth-and-1, fourth-and-2 and so on.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 He relayed his recommendation to the coach, as he always does, balancing his radical approach with the stakes for Mater Dei\'92s season. \'93You don\'92t want to be in the position where you\'92re this analytics guy,\'94 Mahoney said, \'93and you\'92re blowing it for these guys that are legitimately calling X\'92s and O\'92s and working with these kids all year.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Tripping Over the Truth
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 As an agent of change, Mahoney acts deliberately. He knows Mangiero has a threshold for aggressiveness, so he doesn\'92t push him beyond his comfort level. Instead, Mahoney relies on data to make other coaches, as he puts it, trip over the truth \'97 and Mangiero trusts him.

\f2\fs20 \'93He could be anything,\'94 Mangiero said, referring to a job title. \'93The assistant head coach for analytics? Whatever George wants.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 They have known each other for more than 25 years, since Mangiero, 61, a former N.F.L. defensive lineman who is in his fifth season at Mater Dei, coached him at St. Joseph by-the-Sea High School on Staten Island. When he pondered in September adding someone to manage analytics, Mangiero didn\'92t hesitate. He called Mahoney.

It has been an obsession since childhood, when he would accompany his father, George, on calls to repair heating and air-conditioning units.

He is using EdjVarsity for a second consecutive season. \'93You\'92re going to hear it from the parents who have your phone number and aren\'92t afraid to give you a call.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Mahoney was so curious about the challenge of securing community support in that climate that in 2016 he flew to Arkansas to visit another contrarian with a zeal for statistical analysis, Kevin Kelley, who felt like an outcast 17 years ago when he pioneered a no-punt philosophy that has propelled his Pulaski Academy team to eight state titles.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93People want to know why \'97 they really, really do \'97 and as long as you\'92ve got a great reason,\'94 Kelley said, \'93they\'92re willing to at least accept it.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 When Mahoney was promoted to head coach at St. Peter\'92s Boys High School, on Staten Island, in 2018, he reflected on that advice in his introductory speech to parents. Showing a video of two wildebeests standing backside to backside, Mahoney explained that if lions surrounded them, the wildebeests could swing around and protect each other. But if one strayed, the lions could eat them both.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93If you guys stick with us, we\'92ll be OK,\'94 Mahoney said he told the parents. \'93But the second one of you complains that we\'92re not punting, or we onside kick, now you\'92ve exposed ourselves to the lions.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 At St. Peter\'92s, he shortened and streamlined practices to keep players and coaches fresh. By never punting, they could devote more time to offense and defense. He applied the Pareto principle, also known as the 80-20 rule: By focusing on the 20 percent of plays that the opposition ran 80 percent of the time, he eliminated unnecessary film study. Since players weren\'92t running downfield to smash the wedge on kickoffs, their risk of injury was diminished \'97 not a single concussion, he said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 To offset a disadvantage in talent, Mahoney felt St. Peter\'92s had to play differently to compete, and indeed, games there doubled as a veritable advanced-stats carnival: The team used onside kicks, rarely deployed punt returners and went for it at counterintuitive times. Behaving in the extreme, he said, felt like the Spanish conquistador Hern\'e1n Cort\'e9s, who attacked Native Mexicans in 1519 with a small force and, to ensure his troops wouldn\'92t retreat, ordered them to burn the boats they came on. Assistants who didn\'92t agree with Mahoney quit.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 St. Peter\'92s was 5-8 under Mahoney, but the record bothered members of the community less than the image the team projected. Fans booed when the team recovered onside kicks. In citing reasons for Mahoney\'92s dismissal, the principal, Michael Cosentino, mentioned analytics but also said the team wasn\'92t as physical or conditioned as he wanted.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93It didn\'92t seem like we were putting our kids in the right position to win football games,\'94 Cosentino said. \'93Certain things looked good on paper but don\'92t really translate sometimes to the game. When you\'92re dealing with individuals, they\'92re not just numbers, our kids.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Scaling back, Mahoney said, would have felt like a betrayal of his values. But getting fired in the middle of the season still crushed his ego. In the aftermath, he wrote a 12-page treatise assessing his tenure. He attended the Sloan Sports Analytics Conference at M.I.T. and corresponded with Daniel Stern, an analyst with the Baltimore Ravens, one of the more analytics-savvy organizations in the N.F.L.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 As time passed, Mahoney grew ever more confident in his philosophy. It was his presentation that needed refining.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93Most people in the world, they\'92ve never won an argument with statistics,\'94 Mahoney said. \'93To change conventional wisdom, you usually need a good story.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 And when Mangiero called, in early September, Mahoney had one.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The New Guy With the Tablet
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In his first few weeks at Mater Dei, Mahoney felt like an outsider. He worked with the specialists, but mainly, he observed, trying to negotiate his place. He wasn\'92t sure how the other assistants perceived someone, even with his football background, coming in to oversee analytics, and he found it difficult, at first, to form relationships or read their expressions beneath their masks.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 On a staff that skews younger, Mahoney\'92s arrival was met with enthusiasm but also some skepticism \'97 mostly, Mangiero said, from older coaches. But Mahoney had an ally in Mangiero, who said he had been interested in fourth-down aggressiveness since 2009, when New England went for it on fourth-and-2 from its own 28 late in the fourth quarter against Indianapolis \'97 and failed. Intrigued, Mangiero peppered his former player Brian Flores, then a Patriots assistant (and 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 now the Miami Dolphins\'92 coach
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone ), about Coach Bill Belichick\'92s tactics.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 And when the Ravens excelled last season on fourth down, Mangiero went to a game in Baltimore \'97 his friend Joe Cullen is an assistant there \'97 and discussed their methodology afterward with Coach John Harbaugh.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 From Mahoney, Mangiero had heard about EdjVarsity, and asked him to use it to research whether Mater Dei should adjust its punting strategy. Breaking down the Seraphs\'92 27-25 loss in last season\'92s state championship, he told Mangiero a story. On a video chat, Mahoney showed him a presentation detailing how certain decisions affected win probability.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93This whole thing is connected,\'94 Mahoney told him. \'93All this stuff is chapters of a book. Let\'92s put the chapters together and write the whole book.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Impressed, Mangiero, the next day, authorized investing $1,500 to buy an EdjVarsity yearly subscription. To acclimate himself, Mahoney would play an old edition of the Madden video game on simulation mode, pausing after each play to enter the updated details of the game.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Every week, as Mater Dei has tripped over the truth, Mahoney\'92s responsibilities have expanded. He now manages the clock and advises on 2-point conversion strategy. He communicates the fourth-down plan, based on the tablet readouts, early in the series to guide how Mangiero and the offensive coordinator, Taylor Groh, call plays.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 If on third-and-7, for example, Groh knows that Mater Dei will be going for it on fourth-and-3 or less, he might call a play that could net 4 or 5 yards instead of trying to gain all 7 at once.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 During the week, after synthesizing customized postgame reports, Mahoney prepares a slide show presentation for the coaching staff. One was so illuminating, Mangiero said, he showed it to the team as part of a larger message about precision.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 By demonstrating that turnovers cost the Seraphs 15.5 percent in win probability in their previous game, he reframed the importance of ball security in more urgent terms. When someone jumps offsides in practice, Mangiero reinforced his point by saying the offender cost them a touchdown.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Mahoney marvels at how quickly Mater Dei has incorporated analytics, and to its advantage: The Seraphs (4-1) have won four consecutive games heading into Friday\'92s season finale and are positioned to earn a playoff berth.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 He wants to continue bridging the gap between science and 150 years of football. He wants to educate coaches without demanding they conform. He wants to research and experiment, build templates and confidence. He also wants to be a head coach again, and to train an acolyte or two.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Until then, he will appreciate giving Mater Dei an edge, as he did against Middletown South.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 As the final seconds ticked down in the Seraphs\'92 10-3 victory, Mahoney bumped fists with the assistants flanking him. He grabbed his Columbia laptop bag \'97 \'93I need to bring the nerd side of me to football games\'94 \'97 and his headset. One by one, they headed down the stairs, toward the field, to their team, to celebrate together.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Only a few years ago, the idea that for-profit companies and foreign agents could use powerful data technologies to disrupt American democracy would have seemed laughable to most, a plotline from a Cold War espionage movie. And the idea that the American system would be compromised enough to allow outside meddling with the most basic of its democratic functions -- the election of its leaders -- would have seemed even more absurd.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Today we know that this is not fiction but fact. It is a secret so open that even its perpetrators seem halfhearted about hiding it. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Data drives all that we do.'' That is the motto emblazoned on the website of Cambridge Analytica, the consulting firm that was employed by the Trump campaign to influence voters and that is now under scrutiny for its unauthorized harvesting of data from at least 50 million social media users.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The heart of Cambridge Analytica's power is an enormous information warehouse -- as many as 5,000 data points on each of more than 230 million Americans, according to recent reporting, a fact the company proudly confirms on its website. Its promise of elections driven by data ultimately implies a vision of government steered not by people but by algorithms, and by an expanding data-mining culture operating without restrictions.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   That such threats to democracy are now possible is due in part to the fact that our society lacks an information ethics adequate to its deepening dependence on data. Where politics is driven by data, we need a set of ethics to guide that data. But in our rush to deliver on the promises of Big Data, we have not sought one.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   An adequate ethics of data for today would include not only regulatory policy and statutory law governing matters like personal data privacy and implicit bias in algorithms. It would also establish cultural expectations, fortified by extensive education in high schools and colleges, requiring us to think about data technologies as we build them, not after they have already profiled, categorized and otherwise informationalized millions of people. Students who will later turn their talents to the great challenges of 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  would also be trained to consider the ethical design and use of the technologies they will someday unleash.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Clearly, we are not there. High schoolers today may aspire to be the next Mark Zuckerberg, but how many dream of designing ethical data technologies? Who would their role models even be? Executives at Facebook, Twitter and Amazon are among our celebrities today. But how many data ethics advocates can the typical social media user name?
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Our approach to the ethics of data is wholly reactive. Investigations are conducted and apologies are extracted only after damage has been done (and only in some instances). Mr. Zuckerberg seemed to take a positive step on Wednesday, when he vowed to take action to better protect Facebook's user data. ''We also made mistakes, there's more to do, and we need to step up and do it,'' he said in, unsurprisingly, a Facebook post.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   This is like lashing a rope around the cracking foundation of a building. What we need is for an ethics of data to be engineered right into the information skyscrapers being built today. We need data ethics by design. Any good building must comply with a complex array of codes, standards and detailed studies of patterns of use by its eventual inhabitants. But technical systems are today being built with a minimal concern for compliance and a total disregard for the downstream consequences of decades of identifiable data being collected on the babies being born into the most complicated information ecology that has ever existed.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mr. Zuckerberg and other Silicon Valley chiefs admitted in the wake of the election that their platforms needed fixing to help mitigate the bad actors who had exploited social media for political gain. It is not Mr. Zuckerberg's fault that our society has given him a free pass (and a net worth of $67 billion) for inventing his platform first and asking only later what its social consequences might be. It is all of our faults. Thus, however successful Mr. Zuckerberg will be in making amends, he will assuredly do almost nothing to prevent the next wunderkind from coming along and building the next killer app that will unleash who knows what before anybody even has a chance to notice.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The challenge of designing ethics into data technologies is formidable. This is in part because it requires overcoming a century-long ethos of 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone : Develop first, question later. Datafication first, regulation afterward. A glimpse at the history of 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  shows as much.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The techniques that Cambridge Analytica uses to produce its psychometric profiles are the cutting edge of data-driven methodologies first devised 100 years ago. The science of personality research was born in 1917. That year, in the midst of America's fevered entry into war, Robert Sessions Woodworth of Columbia University created the Personal Data Sheet, a questionnaire that promised to assess the personalities of Army recruits. The war ended before Woodworth's psychological instrument was ready for deployment, but the Army had envisioned its use according to the precedent set by the intelligence tests it had been administering to new recruits under the direction of Robert Yerkes, a professor of psychology at Harvard at the time. The data these tests could produce would help decide who should go to the fronts, who was fit to lead and who should stay well behind the lines.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The stakes of those wartime decisions were particularly stark, but the aftermath of those psychometric instruments is even more unsettling. As the century progressed, such tests -- I.Q. tests, college placement exams, predictive behavioral assessments -- would affect the lives of millions of Americans. Schoolchildren who may have once or twice acted out in such a way as to prompt a psychometric evaluation could find themselves labeled, setting them on an inescapable track through the education system.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Researchers like Woodworth and Yerkes (or their Stanford colleague Lewis Terman, who formalized the first SAT) did not anticipate the deep consequences of their work; they were too busy pursuing the great intellectual challenges of their day, much like Mr. Zuckerberg in his pursuit of the next great social media platform. Or like Cambridge Analytica's Christopher Wylie, the twentysomething data scientist who helped build psychometric profiles of two-thirds of all Americans by leveraging personal information gained through uninformed consent. All of these researchers were, quite understandably, obsessed with the great 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  challenges of their generation. Their failure to consider the consequences of their pursuits, however, is not so much their fault as it is our collective failing.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   For the past 100 years we have been chasing visions of data with a singular passion. Many of the best minds of each new generation have devoted themselves to delivering on the inspired 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  promises of their day: intelligence testing, building the computer, cracking the genetic code, creating the internet, and now this. We have in the course of a single century built an entire society, economy and culture that runs on information. Yet we have hardly begun to engineer data ethics appropriate for our extraordinary information carnival. If we do not do so soon, data will drive democracy, and we may well lose our chance to do anything about it.

The data these tests could produce would help decide who should go to the fronts, who was fit to lead and who should stay well behind the lines.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The stakes of those wartime decisions were particularly stark, but the aftermath of those psychometric instruments is even more unsettling. As the century progressed, such tests \'97 I.Q. tests, college placement exams, predictive behavioral assessments \'97 would affect the lives of millions of Americans. Schoolchildren who may have once or twice acted out in such a way as to prompt a psychometric evaluation could find themselves labeled, setting them on an inescapable track through the education system.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Researchers like Woodworth and Yerkes (or their Stanford colleague Lewis Terman, who formalized the first SAT) did not anticipate the deep consequences of their work; they were too busy pursuing the great intellectual challenges of their day, much like Mr. Zuckerberg in his pursuit of the next great social media platform. Or like Cambridge Analytica\'92s

\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , the twentysomething data scientist who helped build psychometric profiles of two-thirds of all Americans by leveraging personal information gained through uninformed consent. All of these researchers were, quite understandably, obsessed with the great 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  challenges of their generation. Their failure to consider the consequences of their pursuits, however, is not so much their fault as it is our collective failing.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 For the past 100 years we have been chasing visions of data with a singular passion. Many of the best minds of each new generation have devoted themselves to delivering on the inspired 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  promises of their day: intelligence testing, building the computer, cracking the genetic code, creating the internet, and now this. We have in the course of a single century built an entire society, economy and culture that runs on information. Yet we have hardly begun to engineer data ethics appropriate for our extraordinary information carnival. If we do not do so soon, data will drive democracy, and we may well lose our chance to do anything about it.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 PALO ALTO, Calif. -- The medical profession has an ethic: First, do no harm.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Silicon Valley has an ethos: Build it first and ask for forgiveness later. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Now, in the wake of fake news and other troubles at tech companies, universities that helped produce some of Silicon Valley's top technologists are hustling to bring a more medicine-like morality to computer science.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   This semester, Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are jointly offering a new course on the ethics and regulation of artificial intelligence. The University of Texas at Austin just introduced a course titled ''Ethical Foundations of Computer Science'' -- with the idea of eventually requiring it for all computer science majors.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   And at Stanford University, the academic heart of the industry, three professors and a research fellow are developing a computer science ethics course for next year. They hope several hundred students will enroll.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The idea is to train the next generation of technologists and policymakers to consider the ramifications of innovations -- like autonomous weapons or self-driving cars -- before those products go on sale.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''It's about finding or identifying issues that we know in the next two, three, five, 10 years, the students who graduate from here are going to have to grapple with,'' said Mehran Sahami, a popular computer science professor at Stanford who is helping to develop the course. He is renowned on campus for bringing Mark Zuckerberg to class.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Technology is not neutral,'' said Professor Sahami, who formerly worked at Google as a senior research scientist. ''The choices that get made in building technology then have social ramifications.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The courses are emerging at a moment when big tech companies have been struggling to handle the side effects -- fake news on Facebook, fake followers on Twitter, lewd children's videos on YouTube -- of the industry's build-it-first mind-set. They amount to an open challenge to a common Silicon Valley attitude that has generally dismissed ethics as a hindrance.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''We need to at least teach people that there's a dark side to the idea that you should move fast and break things,'' said Laura Nor\'e9n, a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for 
\f0\i\b \ul Data Science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  at New York University who began teaching a new 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  ethics course this semester. ''You can patch the software, but you can't patch a person if you, you know, damage someone's reputation.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Computer science programs are required to make sure students have an understanding of ethical issues related to computing in order to be accredited by ABET, a global accreditation group for university science and engineering programs. Some computer science departments have folded the topic into a broader class, and others have stand-alone courses.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   But until recently, ethics did not seem relevant to many students.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Compared to transportation or doctors, your daily interaction with physical harm or death or pain is a lot less if you are writing software for apps,'' said Joi Ito, director of the M.I.T. Media Lab.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   One reason that universities are pushing tech ethics now is the popularization of powerful tools like machine learning -- computer algorithms that can autonomously learn tasks by analyzing large amounts of data. Because such tools could ultimately alter human society, universities are rushing to help students understand the potential consequences, said Mr. Ito, who is co-teaching the Harvard-M.I.T. ethics course.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''As we start to see things, like autonomous vehicles, that clearly have the ability to save people but also cause harm, I think that people are scrambling to build a system of ethics,'' he said. (Mr. Ito is a director of The New York Times Company.)
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Last fall, Cornell University introduced a 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  course where students learned to deal with ethical challenges -- such as biased data sets that include too few lower-income households to be representative of the general population. Students also debated the use of algorithms to help automate life-changing decisions like hiring or college admissions.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''It was really focused on trying to help them understand what in their everyday practice as a data scientist they are likely to confront, and to help them think through those challenges more systematically,'' said Solon Barocas, an assistant professor in information science who taught the course.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   In another Cornell course, Karen Levy, also an assistant professor in information science, is teaching her students to focus more on the ethics of tech companies.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''A lot of ethically charged decision-making has to do with the choices a company makes: what products they choose to develop, what policies they adopt around user data,'' Professor Levy said. ''If 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  ethics training focuses entirely on the individual responsibility of the data scientist, it risks overlooking the role of the broader enterprise.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The Harvard-M.I.T. course, which has 30 students, focuses on the ethical, policy and legal implications of artificial intelligence. It was spurred and financed in part by a new artificial intelligence ethics research fund whose donors include Reid Hoffman, a co-founder of LinkedIn, and the Omidyar Network, the philanthropic investment firm of Pierre Omidyar, the eBay founder.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The curriculum also covers the spread of algorithmic risk scores that use data -- like whether a person was ever suspended from school, or how many of his or her friends have arrest records -- to forecast whether someone is likely to commit a crime. Mr. Ito said he hoped the course would spur students to ask basic ethical questions like: Is the technology fair? How do you make sure that the data is not biased? Should machines be judging humans?
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Some universities offer such programs in their information science, law or philosophy departments. At Stanford, the computer science department will offer the new ethics course, tentatively titled ''Ethics, Public Policy and Computer Science.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The expectations for the course are running high in part because of Professor Sahami's popularity on campus. About 1,500 students take his introductory computer science course every year.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The new ethics course covers topics like artificial intelligence and autonomous machines; privacy and civil rights; and platforms like Facebook. Rob Reich, a Stanford political science professor who is helping to develop the course, said students would be asked to consider those topics from the point of view of software engineers, product designers and policymakers. Students will also be assigned to translate ideal solutions into computer code.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Stanford absolutely has a responsibility to play a leadership role in integrating these perspectives, but so does Carnegie Mellon and Caltech and Berkeley and M.I.T.,'' said Jeremy Weinstein, a Stanford political science professor and co-developer of the ethics course. ''The set of institutions that are generating the next generation of leaders in the technology sector have all got to get on this train.''

\f2\fs20 \cf0 President Trump's blinkered view of 2020 polling has created something of an alternate universe, even as his campaign struggles to find the voters he needs in the data it has.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 When President Trump talks about polling, his focus is very much on survey-takers that he thinks are good for him. Polls that show him trailing Joseph R. Biden Jr. -- virtually all national polls -- are simply ''fake news.'' 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The president's blinkered view has created something of an alternate universe, one not governed by polling averages or independent analysis but by declarative statements that, at times, feel as if they are coming out of nowhere.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   This month, Mr. Trump proclaimed on Twitter that he was ''winning BIG in all of the polls that matter.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Such polls seem to boil down to Rasmussen Reports, which consistently -- and in isolation -- has a rosier picture for the president nationally than other surveys do, and the Trafalgar Group, which has had better numbers for Mr. Trump in Midwestern states.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   His choose-your-own-adventure approach to polling that has shown little understanding of 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone , and his pronouncements have come as his advisers are trying to take in serious polling and data analysis to make sense of what the electorate voting in 2020 will look like.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   It has been a hallmark of Mr. Trump's public commentary since the first time he ran for president that he treats polling as rigged against him if it isn't favorable for him. Despite his campaign spending $10 million over the past two years on some of the most sophisticated data available, the president prefers to use what he sees on the news. And he treats voter support as a mystical, rather than a mathematical, proposition.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Some of Mr. Trump's advisers believe there is a wellspring of ''shy'' or ''hidden'' Trump voters -- predominantly whites without college educations in rural areas -- who are either not candid with pollsters about their choice for president, or aren't responsive to pollsters at all.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   This week, Mr. Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, gave his own view of how polling works to Fox News, trumpeting ''big data modeling'' over old-fashioned phone calling.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''I speak to all my state directors,'' said Mr. Kushner, who has positioned himself as the leader of the Trump campaign, though he is not in fact the campaign manager, adding, ''I do believe that polling with phones to people is an obsolete method, especially in the era of cancel culture. You've got a lot of snake oil salesmen who have kind of been in the business for a long time and they do this.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   He concluded, ''They were all completely wrong last time, and they didn't make any modifications going forward.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   That is not quite true: Though many state polls proved very wrong in 2016, the national polls that projected Hillary Clinton narrowly winning the most votes were close to the mark, and many polling outfits did make modifications, weighting, for instance, for educational backgrounds.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Complaining that polls are ''skewed'' against Republicans has been a vocal pastime of Republican candidates for several election cycles, reaching a high pitch in 2012, when Mitt Romney was the party's presidential nominee.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Officials continue to claim in 2020 that the public polling is wrong because they're ''skewed'' against Mr. Trump, overweighting Democrats in the samples.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Robert Blizzard, a Republican pollster with Public Opinion Strategies, said that incumbents usually ended up ''on Election Day with a ballot share that is within a point or two of their October job approval score.'' In Mr. Trump's case, his average approval score is 45 percent, according to Real Clear Politics.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The Trump campaign has spent years and presumably millions of dollars engaging white voters without college educations who are eligible to vote but did not vote in 2016. There are almost 1.5 million such potential voters in Michigan and more than two million in Pennsylvania.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   But at the end of the day, much of the ''hidden'' vote stays hidden -- that's why voter turnout isn't ever 100 percent, Mr. Blizzard said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Beyond the polling, the fundamentals shaping the electorate, like the economy and the record-breaking coronavirus surge, are ''increasingly ominous'' for Mr. Trump, said Liam Donovan, a veteran Republican strategist.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Ironically, the polls may be the best thing the Trump campaign has going for it at this point,'' he said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   While Mr. Trump makes polling a punchline, both his campaign and the Republican National Committee rely on data to decide where to allocate resources. One of the murkiest issues is modeling for which voters will turn out during a pandemic and an economic downturn.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   And the Trump campaign has kept polling data one of its deepest secrets since leaked internal polling early in the campaign prompted a shake-up of the polling team.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The campaign has been using various analyses, not all of which overlap. Traditional polling has been handled by the Republican pollsters Tony Fabrizio and John McLaughlin, who were hired when Brad Parscale, the previous campaign manager, was running the effort; Mr. Parscale's deputy campaign manager, the former White House political director Bill Stepien, took over in July.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   There has also been analysis by the former Cambridge Analytica official Matt Oczkowski, who is referred to as ''Oz.'' Mr. Kushner has held up Mr. Oczkowski's analyses, which cut against public polling and suggest votes will break Mr. Trump's way in the final days of the campaign, people who have heard the comments said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The amount of polling from Mr. Fabrizio and Mr. McLaughlin has dwindled in recent weeks. Instead, Mr. Stepien quietly hired another pollster, Bill Skelly, who helped create the Republican National Committee's complex modeling for voter turnout scenarios and who is conducting data analysis for the camp, and Brock McCleary, who has worked with clients who include congressional Republicans. Mr. McCleary's estimates of Mr. Trump's poll standing are less ''negative'' than some other Trump pollsters, according to people close to the campaign.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mr. Parscale, who had worked fairly closely with the R.N.C., had envisioned continuous robust television ad spending through the year. Since he stepped aside, the Trump campaign, which has far less money than advisers had once anticipated, has slashed its television spending. Exactly what data has driven the allocation of the campaign's remaining ad spending is unclear.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Two Republicans said that from the time Mr. Parscale was demoted until a meeting a few weeks ago, the campaign had not reviewed R.N.C. data that tracks specific voters and likelihood they'll support the president. That meeting was convened by Mr. Kushner to get the campaign and the R.N.C. to work together more effectively. Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman, denied that was the case, and a spokesman for the R.N.C. said the organizations were working effectively together.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The R.N.C. turnout models vary by state, but in some scenarios, it shows Mr. Trump performing worse than he does in the campaign's own polls, two people briefed on the numbers said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Nonetheless, that meeting led to a final $26 million television allocation led by the R.N.C.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Whether the weeks without a unified front between the campaign and the party committee will have been a significant factor in the outcome of the race remains to be seen. And whether the ''hidden'' voters the Trump team has sought matters more than a few percentage points is also unclear.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Alessandra Biaggi, Nathaniel Koloc
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Alessandra Rose Biaggi and Nathaniel Smith Koloc met in January 2015 when both were New York City New Leaders Council fellows. They gathered in Manhattan to learn about progressive politics, entrepreneurship and campaigns one weekend a month for five months.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93In the first session we didn\'92t talk to each other,\'94 Ms. Biaggi said, \'93but without saying anything there was an energy.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Mr. Koloc could also sense her intensity and seriousness. \'93We were two of the people in the group who were asking speakers the hardest questions,\'92\'92 he said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 At the February meeting, after Mr. Koloc was offered the role of the director of talent acquisition and development on Mrs. Clinton\'92s presidential campaign-in-waiting team, he asked Ms. Biaggi about her job and her next move.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93I\'92m going to work in the White House,\'92\'92 said Ms. Biaggi without skipping a beat.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Mr. Koloc, taken by her moxie, asked if she would work on a campaign, which she quickly took to mean a local one.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93How about a presidential race,\'92\'92 he countered, and his calm audacity stunned her.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93Who is this person,\'92\'92 she recalled thinking.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 At the March meeting Mr. Koloc, more sure-footed in his job, asked Ms. Biaggi to send her r\'e9sum\'e9 to the campaign, and by May she was on its vetting team.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93Everything was urgent in the moment,\'92\'92 said Ms. Biaggi, who vetted anything that touched Mrs. Clinton, including staff, volunteers, individuals, locations and social media influencers. \'93It was total chaos and I loved it.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 After a few weeks of sitting six desks from each other, they began grabbing coffee together or walking along the Brooklyn Heights Promenade during breaks.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In June, as they left a Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett benefit at the Plaza, Ms. Biaggi\'92s mother called to tell her that her grandfather, Mario Biaggi, died, and was touched when Mr. Koloc then showed up at her grandfather\'92s wake.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93It was a meaningful and hard moment,\'94 she said.

\f2\fs20 Crystal Sanders, Uwemedimo Umoumoh
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The couple were made aware of each other in March 2017. An uncle of Mr. Umoumoh, who also happened to be a colleague of Ms. Sanders at Penn State, told her she would be an excellent match for his nephew, who was teaching chemistry and geography at a middle school in Uyo.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93The person he described to me seemed like a really nice guy, but he happened to live on another continent,\'94 Ms. Sanders said. \'93Besides, I wasn\'92t interested in getting set up.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 She passed along her email address and had all but forgotten about Mr. Umoumoh until the following month, when she received a message from him.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93One of the first things he tells me is that he has no interest in a relationship, and that he was pretty much calling as a favor to his uncle, because when an elder in Nigeria asks you to do something, you just do it,\'94 Ms. Sanders said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 They proceeded to chat for a while and emailed each other periodically. He eventually asked for her phone number and began texting her, and by early October 2017, they were chatting on the phone.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93It had really turned into a pretty nice friendship,\'94 Mr. Umoumoh said. \'93We even started giving each other dating advice.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Ms. Sanders began to see Mr. Umoumoh in a different light \'93when he began talking about his personal life and the failed relationships he was a part of,\'94 she said. \'93He was the first guy I ever knew who did not place all of the blame on the women he had broken up with, choosing instead to put a lot of the blame squarely on his shoulders, and I admired the fact that he was honest and mature enough to admit that.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 A world away, Mr. Umoumoh\'92s admiration and feelings for Ms. Sanders were also blossoming.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93Despite the distance between us, we had so many things in common, especially the fact that we have a very strong Christian faith,\'94 he said. \'93Every conversation was better than the one before, and the one thing I really enjoyed about talking to her was that she let me be myself.\'94

\f2\fs20 \cf0 President Trump\'92s blinkered view of 2020 polling has created something of an alternate universe, even as his campaign struggles to find the voters he needs in the data it has.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 When President Trump talks about polling, his focus is very much on 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 survey-takers that he thinks are good for him
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone . Polls that show him trailing Joseph R. Biden Jr. \'97 virtually all national polls \'97 are simply \'93fake news.\'94
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The president\'92s blinkered view has created something of an alternate universe, one not governed by polling averages or independent analysis but by declarative statements that, at times, feel as if they are coming out of nowhere.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This month, Mr. Trump proclaimed on Twitter that he was \'93winning BIG in all of the polls that matter.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Such polls seem to boil down to Rasmussen Reports, which consistently \'97 and in isolation \'97 has a rosier picture for the president nationally than other surveys do, and the Trafalgar Group, which has had better numbers for Mr. Trump in Midwestern states.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 His choose-your-own-adventure approach to polling that has shown little understanding of 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone , and his pronouncements have come as his advisers are trying to take in serious polling and data analysis to make sense of what the electorate voting in 2020 will look like.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It has been a hallmark of Mr. Trump\'92s public commentary since the first time he ran for president that he treats polling as rigged against him if it isn\'92t favorable for him. Despite his campaign spending $10 million over the past two years on some of the most sophisticated data available, the president prefers to use what he sees on the news. And he treats voter support as a mystical, rather than a mathematical, proposition.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Some of Mr. Trump\'92s advisers believe there is a wellspring of \'93shy\'94 or \'93hidden\'94 Trump voters \'97 predominantly whites without college educations in rural areas \'97 who are either not candid with pollsters about their choice for president, or aren\'92t responsive to pollsters at all.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This week, Mr. Trump\'92s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, gave his own view of how polling works to Fox News, trumpeting \'93big data modeling\'94 over old-fashioned phone calling.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93I speak to all my state directors,\'94 said Mr. Kushner, who has positioned himself as the leader of the Trump campaign, though he is not in fact the campaign manager, adding, \'93I do believe that polling with phones to people is an obsolete method, especially in the era of cancel culture. You\'92ve got a lot of snake oil salesmen who have kind of been in the business for a long time and they do this.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 He concluded, \'93They were all completely wrong last time, and they didn\'92t make any modifications going forward.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 That is not quite true: Though many state polls proved very wrong in 2016, the national polls that projected Hillary Clinton narrowly winning the most votes were close to the mark, and many polling outfits did make modifications, weighting, for instance, for educational backgrounds.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Complaining that polls are \'93skewed\'94 against Republicans has been a vocal pastime of Republican candidates for several election cycles, reaching a high pitch in 2012, when Mitt Romney was the party\'92s presidential nominee.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Officials continue to claim in 2020 that the public polling is wrong because they\'92re \'93skewed\'94 against Mr. Trump, overweighting Democrats in the samples.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Robert Blizzard, a Republican pollster with Public Opinion Strategies, said that incumbents usually ended up \'93on Election Day with a ballot share that is within a point or two of their October job approval score.\'94 In Mr. Trump\'92s case, his average approval score is 45 percent, according to Real Clear Politics.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The Trump campaign has spent years and presumably millions of dollars engaging white voters without college educations who are 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 eligible to vote but did not vote in 2016
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone . There are almost 1.5 million such potential voters in Michigan and more than two million in Pennsylvania.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 But at the end of the day, much of the \'93hidden\'94 vote stays hidden \'97 that\'92s why voter turnout isn\'92t ever 100 percent, Mr. Blizzard said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Beyond the polling, the fundamentals shaping the electorate, like the economy and the record-breaking coronavirus surge, are \'93increasingly ominous\'94 for Mr. Trump, said Liam Donovan, a veteran Republican strategist.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93Ironically, the polls may be the best thing the Trump campaign has going for it at this point,\'94 he said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 While Mr. Trump makes polling a punchline, both his campaign and the Republican National Committee rely on data to decide where to allocate resources. One of the murkiest issues is modeling which voters will turn out during a pandemic and an economic downturn.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 And the Trump campaign has kept polling data secret since leaked internal polling early in the campaign prompted a shake-up of the polling team.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The campaign has been using various analyses, not all of which overlap. Traditional polling has been handled by the Republican pollsters Tony Fabrizio and John McLaughlin, who were hired when Brad Parscale, the previous campaign manager, was running the effort; Mr. Parscale\'92s deputy campaign manager, the former White House political director Bill Stepien, took over in July.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 There has also been analysis by the former Cambridge Analytica official Matt Oczkowski, who is referred to as \'93Oz.\'94 Mr. Kushner has held up Mr. Oczkowski\'92s analyses, which cut against public polling and suggest votes will break Mr. Trump\'92s way in the final days of the campaign, people who have heard the comments said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The amount of polling from Mr. Fabrizio and Mr. McLaughlin has dwindled in recent weeks. Instead, Mr. Stepien quietly hired another pollster, Bill Skelly, who helped create the Republican National Committee\'92s complex modeling for voter turnout scenarios and who is conducting data analysis for the camp, and Brock McCleary, who has worked with clients who include congressional Republicans. Mr. McCleary\'92s estimates of Mr. Trump\'92s poll standing are less \'93negative\'94 than some other Trump pollsters, according to people close to the campaign.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Mr. Parscale, who had worked fairly closely with the R.N.C., had envisioned continuous robust television ad spending through the year. Since he stepped aside, the Trump campaign, which has far less money than advisers had once anticipated, has slashed its television spending. Exactly what data has driven the allocation of the campaign\'92s remaining ad spending is unclear.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Two Republicans said that from the time Mr. Parscale was demoted until a meeting a few weeks ago, the campaign had not reviewed R.N.C. data that tracks specific voters and likelihood they\'92ll support the president. That meeting was convened by Mr. Kushner to get the campaign and the R.N.C. to work together more effectively. Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman, denied that was the case, and a spokesman for the R.N.C. said the organizations were working effectively together.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The R.N.C. turnout models vary by state, but in some scenarios, it shows Mr. Trump performing worse than he does in the campaign\'92s own polls, two people briefed on the numbers said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Nonetheless, that meeting led to a final $26 million television allocation led by the R.N.C.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Whether the weeks without a unified front between the campaign and the party committee will have been a significant factor in the outcome of the race remains to be seen. And whether the \'93hidden\'94 voters the Trump team has sought matters more than a few percentage points is also unclear.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The national priority in education can be summed up in a four-letter acronym: STEM. And that's understandable. A country's proficiency in science, technology, engineering and mathematics is vital in generating economic growth, advancing scientific innovation and creating good jobs.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The STEM campaign has been underway for years, championed by policymakers across the ideological spectrum, embraced in schools everywhere and by organizations ranging from the YWCA to the Boy Scouts. By now, the term -- first popularized and promoted by the National Science Foundation -- is used as a descriptive identifier. ''She's a STEM,'' usually meant as a compliment, suggests someone who has a leg up in the college admissions sweepstakes. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Much of the public enthusiasm for STEM education rests on the assumption that these fields are rich in job opportunity. Some are, some aren't. STEM is an expansive category, spanning many disciplines and occupations, from software engineers and data scientists to geologists, astronomers and physicists.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   What recent studies have made increasingly apparent is that the greatest number of high-paying STEM jobs are in the ''T'' (specifically, computing).
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Earlier this year, Glassdoor, a jobs listing website, ranked the median base salary of workers in their first five years of employment by undergraduate major. Computer science topped the list ($70,000), followed by electrical engineering ($68,438). Biochemistry ($46,406) and biotechnology ($48,442) were among the lowest paying majors in the study, which also confirmed that women are generally underrepresented in STEM majors.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''There is a huge divide between the computing technology roles and the traditional sciences,'' said Andrew Chamberlain, Glassdoor's chief economist.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   At LinkedIn, researchers identified the skills most in demand. The top 10 last year were all computer skills, including expertise in cloud computing, data mining and statistical analysis, and writing smartphone applications.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   In a recent analysis, Edward Lazowska, a professor of computer science at the University of Washington, focused on the Bureau of Labor Statistics employment forecasts in STEM categories. In the decade ending in 2024, 73 percent of STEM job growth will be in computer occupations, but only 3 percent will be in the physical sciences and 3 percent in the life sciences.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   A working grasp of the principles of science and math should be essential knowledge for all Americans, said Michael S. Teitelbaum, an expert on science education and policy. But he believes that STEM advocates, often executives and lobbyists for technology companies, do a disservice when they raise the alarm that America is facing a worrying shortfall of STEM workers, based on shortages in a relative handful of fast-growing fields like data analytics, artificial intelligence, cloud computing and computer security.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''When it gets generalized to all of STEM, it's misleading,'' said Mr. Teitelbaum, a senior research associate in the Labor and Worklife Program at Harvard Law School. ''We're misleading a lot of young people.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Unemployment rates for STEM majors may be low, but not all of those with undergraduate degrees end up in their field of study -- only 13 percent in life sciences and 17 percent in physical sciences, according to a 2013 National Science Foundation survey. Computer science is the only STEM field where more than half of graduates are employed in their field.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   If physicists and biologists want to enjoy the boom times in the digital economy, a few specialist start-ups will train them and find them jobs as data scientists and artificial intelligence programmers.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Insight 
\f0\i\b \ul Data Science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Fellows Program, which has offices in New York, Boston, Seattle and Palo Alto, Calif., began its first training program five years ago and now has 900 alumni working at companies like Facebook, LinkedIn, Airbnb, Amazon and Microsoft. Jake Klamka, a physicist who founded the program, kept hearing from Silicon Valley executives that they had considered hiring traditional scientists, but converting them to technologists seemed time-consuming and risky. So Mr. Klamka decided he would start a company to provide scientists a smoother pathway into the tech industry.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Carlos Faham made that passage. He had an impressive academic career, with a string of grant awards and fellowships. His Ph.D. from Brown University was in dark-matter physics. After Brown, he was a postdoctoral fellow at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Dr. Faham loved the research, but after nearly two years he was feeling the strain of that life. By then, he had spent 12 years in college, graduate school and postgraduate research. His next step would be to compete for a handful of tenure-track teaching openings across the country. For the pricey Bay Area, he wasn't making enough. A postdoc researcher typically makes $40,000 to $60,000 a year.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Dr. Faham had done serious programming for his physics research. He applied to tech companies, figuring they would be eager to hire someone with his intellectual firepower. He couldn't get an in-person interview. He was told his background was too academic. He fumbled a couple of phone screening interviews because the statistical and machine-learning problems were unfamiliar to him.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''It was like hitting a wall running at full speed, really humbling,'' he recalled.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Dr. Faham joined the seven-week Insight 
\f0\i\b \ul Data Science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Fellows program in 2015. There was no formal course work. Other than a few tutorials by industry people, the time was spent creating a product -- his was software for recognizing and tracking faces in video -- and training for interviews. That involved solving a programming problem on a white board and explaining his thinking. ''Interviewing is a muscle and you have to exercise it again and again,'' he said. After the program, he received six job offers. He accepted the offer from LinkedIn. (Insight is free for participants; hiring companies pay an undisclosed fee.)
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Today, Dr. Faham, 33, is a senior data scientist, working on a team that uses machine learning and statistical models to detect illicit activity on the social network, including fake job listings, ad fraud, spam and bot attacks.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The range of data-intensive detective work, he said, is ''extremely rich'' and ''it moves so much faster than my previous world.'' He makes a ''pretty good six-figure salary,'' about five times what he did as a postdoctoral researcher.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   About 90 percent of those who enter the Insight program have landed jobs as data analysts, the company says, with a dropout rate of about 3 percent.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Anasuya Das made a similar career move, but not one as far from her academic training. After the program, Dr. Das, whose Ph.D. is in neuroscience, joined the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, where she is now a senior data scientist. She works on a team that creates software tools for the center's doctors, nurses and researchers. One current project is a program to recommend the most promising clinical trials for individual cancer patients, based on their medical histories, age, gender and genetics.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   
\f0\i\b \ul Data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  is distinctly different from neuroscience, Dr. Das said, but some of the tools she employs, like a machine-learning technique called artificial neural networks, do take their inspiration from the brain. Her experience points to the larger trend that digital technologies like 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  and artificial intelligence are increasingly being used in nearly every discipline. So technology and the other STEM fields merge.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   That is the thinking behind a new division of data sciences at the University of California, Berkeley, that started in July. The division is a response to student demand and advancing technology. Berkeley's ''Foundations of 
\f0\i\b \ul Data Science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone '' course attracted 1,200 students from more than 50 majors in the last academic year.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The choice of the term ''division'' rather than ''institute,'' explained David Culler, the interim dean for data sciences, underlines its approach. ''We want this to be something foundational across the university, innovating with other disciplines, not differentiating from them,'' he said. ''This is the academic world mirroring what is happening in the larger economy.''

\cf0 The national priority in education can be summed up in a four-letter acronym: STEM. And that\'92s understandable. A country\'92s proficiency in science, technology, engineering and mathematics is vital in generating economic growth, advancing scientific innovation and creating good jobs.\
The STEM campaign has been underway for years, championed by policymakers across the ideological spectrum, embraced in schools everywhere and by organizations ranging from the YWCA to the Boy Scouts. By now, the term \'97 first popularized and promoted by the National Science Foundation \'97 is used as a descriptive identifier. \'93She\'92s a STEM,\'94 usually meant as a compliment, suggests someone who has a leg up in the college admissions sweepstakes.\
Much of the public enthusiasm for STEM education rests on the assumption that these fields are rich in job opportunity. Some are, some aren\'92t. STEM is an expansive category, spanning many disciplines and occupations, from software engineers and data scientists to geologists, astronomers and physicists.\
What recent studies have made increasingly apparent is that the greatest number of high-paying STEM jobs are in the \'93T\'94 (specifically, computing).\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Earlier this year, 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Glassdoor
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , a jobs listing website, ranked the median base salary of workers in their first five years of employment by undergraduate major. Computer science topped the       \'a0    
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 list
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  ($70,000), followed by electrical engineering ($68,438). Biochemistry ($46,406) and biotechnology ($48,442) were among the lowest paying majors in the study, which also confirmed that women are generally underrepresented in STEM majors.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \'93There is a huge divide between the computing technology roles and the traditional sciences,\'94 said Andrew Chamberlain, Glassdoor\'92s chief economist.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 At LinkedIn, researchers identified the skills most in demand. The 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 top 10
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  last year were all computer skills, including expertise in cloud computing, data mining and statistical analysis, and writing smartphone applications.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 In a recent analysis, Edward Lazowska, a professor of computer science at the University of Washington, focused on the Bureau of Labor Statistics employment forecasts in STEM categories. In the decade ending in 2024, 73 percent of STEM job growth will be in computer occupations, but only 3 percent will be in the physical sciences and 3 percent in the life sciences.\
A working grasp of the principles of science and math should be essential knowledge for all Americans, said Michael S. Teitelbaum, an expert on science education and policy. But he believes that STEM advocates, often executives and lobbyists for technology companies, do a disservice when they raise the alarm that America is facing a worrying shortfall of STEM workers, based on shortages in a relative handful of fast-growing fields like data analytics, artificial intelligence, cloud computing and computer security.\
\'93When it gets generalized to all of STEM, it\'92s misleading,\'94 said Mr. Teitelbaum, a senior research associate in the Labor and Worklife Program at Harvard Law School. \'93We\'92re misleading a lot of young people.\'94\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Unemployment rates for STEM majors may be low, but not all of those with undergraduate degrees end up in their field of study \'97 only 13 percent in life sciences and 17 percent in physical sciences, according to a 2013 National Science Foundation 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 survey
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone . Computer science is the only STEM field where more than half of graduates are employed in their field.\

\cf0 If physicists and biologists want to enjoy the boom times in the digital economy, a few specialist start-ups will train them and find them jobs as data scientists and artificial intelligence programmers.\

\f0\i\b \ul Data Science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Fellows 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Program
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , which has offices in New York, Boston, Seattle and Palo Alto, Calif., began its first training program five years ago and now has 900 alumni working at companies like Facebook, LinkedIn, Airbnb, Amazon and Microsoft. Jake Klamka, a physicist who founded the program, kept hearing from Silicon Valley executives that they had considered hiring traditional scientists, but converting them to technologists seemed time-consuming and risky. So Mr. Klamka decided he would start a company to provide scientists a smoother pathway into the tech industry.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Carlos Faham made that passage. He had an impressive academic career, with a string of grant awards and fellowships. His Ph.D. from Brown University was in dark-matter physics. After Brown, he was a postdoctoral fellow at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.\
Dr. Faham loved the research, but after nearly two years he was feeling the strain of that life. By then, he had spent 12 years in college, graduate school and postgraduate research. His next step would be to compete for a handful of tenure-track teaching openings across the country. For the pricey Bay Area, he wasn\'92t making enough. A postdoc researcher typically makes $40,000 to $60,000 a year.\
Dr. Faham had done serious programming for his physics research. He applied to tech companies, figuring they would be eager to hire someone with his intellectual firepower. He couldn\'92t get an in-person interview. He was told his background was too academic. He fumbled a couple of phone screening interviews because the statistical and machine-learning problems were unfamiliar to him.\
\'93It was like hitting a wall running at full speed, really humbling,\'94 he recalled.\
Dr. Faham joined the seven-week Insight 
\f0\i\b \ul Data Science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Fellows program in 2015. There was no formal course work. Other than a few tutorials by industry people, the time was spent creating a product \'97 his was software for recognizing and tracking faces in video \'97 and training for interviews. That involved solving a programming problem on a white board and explaining his thinking. \'93Interviewing is a muscle and you have to exercise it again and again,\'94 he said. After the program, he received six job offers. He accepted the offer from LinkedIn. (Insight is free for participants; hiring companies pay an undisclosed fee.)\
Today, Dr. Faham, 33, is a senior data scientist, working on a team that uses machine learning and statistical models to detect illicit activity on the social network, including fake job listings, ad fraud, spam and bot attacks.\
The range of data-intensive detective work, he said, is \'93extremely rich\'94 and \'93it moves so much faster than my previous world.\'94 He makes a \'93pretty good six-figure salary,\'94 about five times what he did as a postdoctoral researcher.\
About 90 percent of those who enter the Insight program have landed jobs as data analysts, the company says, with a dropout rate of about 3 percent.\
Anasuya Das made a similar career move, but not one as far from her academic training. After the program, Dr. Das, whose Ph.D. is in neuroscience, joined the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, where she is now a senior data scientist. She works on a team that creates software tools for the center\'92s doctors, nurses and researchers. One current project is a program to recommend the most promising clinical trials for individual cancer patients, based on their medical histories, age, gender and genetics.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f0\i\b \cf0 \ul \ulc0 Data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  is distinctly different from neuroscience, Dr. Das said, but some of the tools she employs, like a machine-learning technique called artificial neural networks, do take their inspiration from the brain. Her experience points to the larger trend that digital technologies like 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  and artificial intelligence are increasingly being used in nearly every discipline. So technology and the other STEM fields merge.\
That is the thinking behind a new division of data sciences at the University of California, Berkeley, that started in July. The division is a response to student demand and advancing technology. Berkeley\'92s \'93Foundations of 
\f0\i\b \ul Data Science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone \'94 course attracted 1,200 students from more than 50 majors in the last academic year.\
The choice of the term \'93division\'94 rather than \'93institute,\'94 explained David Culler, the interim dean for data sciences, underlines its approach. \'93We want this to be something foundational across the university, innovating with other disciplines, not differentiating from them,\'94 he said. \'93This is the academic world mirroring what is happening in the larger economy.\'94\

\cf0 \'93Covid-19 tore a hole through the U.S. economy,\'94 says The New York Times\'92 October 3, 2020 article \'93Job Gains Lose Momentum As Promising Recovery Stalls.\'94 As of October, the national economy had 11 million fewer jobs than before the pandemic. The total number of unemployed workers both in and out of the workforce, which is calculated from different sources than the jobs data, went from 12 million in January 2020, then exploded to 32 million in April 2020 (167 percent increase) before subsiding to 19 million by September 2020. (This was an 58 percent increase over January 2020). It is not surprising that in an October 5-11, 2020 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 online survey
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  conducted by SurveyMonkey for The New York Times, 30 percent of respondents said that they were financially worse off.\

\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone .\'94 It shows the composition of the \'93total unemployed\'94, those who have been temporarily laid off, have been out of work for less than four weeks, or are in the \'93other\'94 category. The \'93other\'94 category of unemployed workers includes those who had temporary jobs or who chose to leave their jobs because of transportation issues, needing to care for their family, susceptibility to the virus, and other issues. The graph also shows the number of workers who are not in the labor force (including those who have been unemployed for more than four weeks), but want a job.\

\cf0 STACKED AREA GRAPH\
Stacked area graphs show trends over time and compare the relative sizes of subgroups of a whole. The comparison may be in terms of absolute numbers or percentages.\
In the pandemic unemployment graph, the time period is January 2020 to September 2020. The whole is the total number of unemployed plus people who are not in the labor force but want a job. The category of unemployed is divided into the subgroups of temporarily laid off, permanently laid off, and other. The other category includes workers who chose to leave their jobs or who had temporary jobs. What is usual about this graph is that time is on the vertical axis and the number of workers is on the horizontal axis. The variable, number of workers, is represented by the total distance from both sides of the center vertical line.\

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The pioneering online learning networks offer hard-earned lessons for what works and what doesn't with online education.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Sandeep Gupta, a technology manager in California, sees the economic storm caused by the coronavirus as a time ''to try to future-proof your working life.'' So he is taking an online course in artificial intelligence. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Dr. Robert Davidson, an emergency-room physician in Michigan, says the pandemic has cast ''a glaring light on the shortcomings of our public health infrastructure.'' So he is pursuing an online master's degree in public health.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Children and college students aren't the only ones turning to online education during the coronavirus pandemic. Millions of adults have signed up for online classes in the last two months, too -- a jolt that could signal a renaissance for big online learning networks that had struggled for years.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Coursera, in which Mr. Gupta and Dr. Davidson enrolled, added 10 million new users from mid-March to mid-May, seven times the pace of new sign-ups in the previous year. Enrollments at edX and Udacity, two smaller education sites, have jumped by similar multiples.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Crises lead to accelerations, and this is best chance ever for online learning,'' said Sebastian Thrun, a co-founder and chairman of Udacity.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Coursera, Udacity and edX sprang up nearly a decade ago as high-profile university experiments known as MOOCs, for massive open online courses. They were portrayed as tech-fueled insurgents destined to disrupt the antiquated ways of traditional higher education. But few people completed courses, grappling with the same challenges now facing students forced into distance learning because of the pandemic. Screen fatigue sets in, and attention strays.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The sites even became a punchline among academics: ''Remember the MOOCs?''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   But the online ventures adapted through trial and error, gathering lessons that could provide a road map for schools districts and universities pushed online. The instructional ingredients of success, the sites found, include short videos of six minutes or less, interspersed with interactive drills and tests; online forums where students share problems and suggestions; and online mentoring and tutoring.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Active learning works, and social learning works,'' said Anant Agarwal, founder and chief executive of edX. ''And you have to understand that teaching online and learning online are skills of their own.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The proclaimed mission of the MOOCs was to ''democratize education.'' The early courses attracted hundreds of thousands of students from around the world.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Udacity and Coursera were founded at Stanford University by high-profile professors in the hot field of artificial intelligence. EdX, created by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University in 2012, is a nonprofit.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Coursera and Udacity soon attracted money from Silicon Valley's leading venture firms. The courses were all free. It was the classic internet formula: lure a big audience, and figure out a business model later.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Executives eventually discovered that earning credentials for completing courses and paying fees drove completion rates far higher. Typically, 10 percent or fewer students complete free courses, while the completion rates for paid courses that grant certificates or degrees range from 40 percent to 90 percent.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   A few top-tier universities, such as the University of Michigan and the Georgia Institute of Technology, offer some full degree programs through the online platforms. Dr. Davidson is taking Michigan's public health course.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   While those academic programs are available, the online schools have tilted, either cautiously or wholeheartedly, toward skills-focused courses that match student demand and hiring trends.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Our main goal is to solve learning, not the skills problem,'' Mr. Agarwal said. ''Though frankly, that's where the money is.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Udacity has made the most drastic transformation toward a skills factory. It has developed dozens of courses on its own and with corporate collaborators including Google, Amazon and Mercedes. Its course offerings are largely in digital skills like programming, 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  and artificial intelligence, fields where companies say they need workers.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Companies are better positioned to see where the jobs of tomorrow will be and prepare people for them than universities,'' Mr. Thrun said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Just a couple of years ago, Udacity's survival was in doubt. When Mr. Thrun returned to oversee operations in 2018, it was a few months from running out of cash. Over the next two years, Mr. Thrun laid off about half the work force. ''The worst period of my life,'' he recalled.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Today, with 320 employees and 1,300 part-time project reviewers and mentors, Udacity's fortunes have improved. It is tightly focused on its training business, for both individual students and for corporations that pay Udacity to upgrade the skills of their employees and to advise them on redeploying workers in digital operations.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The Udacity courses, which it calls nanodegrees, take most students four to six months to complete, if they put in 10 hours a week. The average cost is $1,200. The learning is based on projects, rapid feedback -- including project reviews in two hours -- and online mentoring.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   David Hundley has taken several Udacity courses in 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  and machine learning in the last two years. A business analyst at State Farm, he wanted to develop tech skills for a better job and brighter career prospects.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Today, Mr. Hundley, 30, is proficient in modern software tools like Python and TensorFlow and has a portfolio of projects on GitHub, where software developers display their work. In January, he landed a new job at the insurance company as a machine-learning engineer.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   State Farm paid for a couple of the Udacity courses, and he paid for the others. ''It was a hundred-percent worth it,'' Mr. Hundley said. ''Two years ago, I didn't know anything about coding. Now, I'm a machine-learning engineer.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Coursera is a hybrid, retaining much of the character of the original MOOCs, while striving to build a sizable business.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Coursera has raised more than $300 million in venture funding over the years. It hosts more than 4,000 courses, created mainly by university professors but also by companies like Google and IBM. The certificate courses are typically priced at $39 to $79 a month, or a $399 annual fee. University master's degree programs start at $15,000 and go up to $40,000.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   But fewer than 10 percent of Coursera students pay for courses; they take them free. That is part of the company's mixed model of offering both free and paid-for learning options, said Jeff Maggioncalda, chief executive of Coursera, noting that 60 percent of students in its degree programs try free courses first.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Some of the most popular courses are not about writing code or making money. The breakout hit of the pandemic season is ''The Science of Well-Being'' by Laurie Santos, a professor of psychology at Yale University.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mr. Maggioncalda describes Coursera as a ''managed marketplace,'' similar in concept to Apple's app store. Coursera determines which institutions get to publish courses on its platform, and has rules and guidelines for format standards and price ranges. For degree courses, universities collect 60 percent of the revenue and Coursera 40 percent. On certificate courses, mainly in technology and business subjects, the split is 50-50.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The millions of people flocking to take courses on Coursera in recent weeks suggest the brand value of its learning network. About half the company's 600 employees are product managers, engineers and data scientists, working to improve the online learning experience and more effectively market the university courses.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Before the pandemic hit, Coursera projected growth of 30 percent this year, to more than $200 million. That forecast looks decidedly outdated, given the surge in the last two months, but how long the trend lasts is uncertain.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The Covid-19 effect on online learning could broaden the range of popular subjects, education experts say. But so far, training for the tech economy is where the digital-learning money lies. With more of work and everyday life moving online -- some of it permanently -- that will probably not change.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Digital-skills jobs will be where there is greatest demand,'' Mr. Maggioncalda said, ''and those jobs will be less likely to be affected by pandemics in the future.''

\f2\fs20 \cf0 With proper funding and innovation, two-year public colleges can handle job training for millions of people.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Millions of laid-off American workers need new careers, yet the United States gives much less assistance to job seekers than most other countries. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Community colleges could bridge the gap, partnering with employers and innovators in the private sector to train workers for careers that meet local needs and pay middle-class wages.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   But they will be unable to do so unless Congress provides financial relief to state and local governments. When they are needed most, these two-year public institutions are themselves in desperate financial straits.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   History is repeating itself. In the last recession a decade ago, lower state tax revenues and budget cuts left community colleges unable to meet demand. Unemployed job seekers turned to for-profit colleges, often with disastrous results. Community colleges have seen budget cuts and enrollment declines this fall, while for-profit online training is growing rapidly.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The time for action is now. While the U.S. unemployment rate has fallen from its April peak, an increasing share of job losses are permanent rather than temporary. In August, 3.4 million workers lost their jobs for good, compared with only 2 million in April.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Losing a job is almost always harmful, but the economic impact is far more severe when it occurs during a recession. One study found that job loss during a period of high unemployment led to 20 percent lower earnings more than a decade later, and a cumulative loss of nearly three years of full-time earnings. This is because workers laid off during recessions take much longer to find a new full-time job.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   For this reason, job search assistance and training provide an important safety net for displaced workers, yet the United States spends a paltry 0.1 percent of gross domestic product on so-called active labor market policies, less than one-fifth the average of other developed nations. This is unfortunate, because a recent review of more than 200 studies finds that job training has large, long-term effects on employment, especially during recessions.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Public job training programs should, therefore, increase activity during downturns, but the opposite happens. Despite surging demand at community colleges, state spending on higher education fell by 20 percent from 2008 to 2013, in the depths of the Great Recession. Many people who were turned away or placed on long wait-lists found their way to for-profit colleges, which nearly doubled their total enrollment from 2007 to 2010. We are already seeing a reprise of this pattern in the last few months.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   In the last recession, for-profit colleges were generally a bad deal for students. Graduates had lower earnings, were less frequently employed and had greater student debt than similar students who attended public colleges. Outcomes were particularly poor in online institutions.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   These problems appear to be intrinsic features of for-profit education. Markets only work well when there is a shared understanding of product quality among buyers and sellers. But in education, quality is amorphous and multidimensional. Students agree to pay up front, and only find out whether they got a good deal many years later. As a result, students are highly vulnerable to the opportunism of for-profit colleges, which are inevitably tempted to increase profits by cutting corners.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   By contrast, community college job training programs substantially increase participants' earnings, and because tuition costs are relatively low, they typically provide a good return on public investment.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   But underfunding and overcrowding mean that the most valuable community college programs are often unavailable to many students. One recent study found that applicants who randomly won a slot in a lottery to attend a nursing program had 44 percent higher earnings four years later. Yet because of budgetary limitations, only one in eight applicants could attend. Separate research showed that when community college funding has increased, the money has generally been spent directly on instruction and academic support for students, boosting graduation rates.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   As public institutions, community colleges are not always sensitive to market signals. For-profit colleges offer a disproportionate share of short-term training programs for medical and pharmacy technicians and other fields where jobs are relatively plentiful. Companies like Google, IBM, LinkedIn, and Coursera have begun offering online courses in computer programming and 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone . For programs like these, the profit motive is a strength, rather than a weakness.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Nonetheless, community colleges should be the main place to train America's workers, because they are mission-oriented and well trusted. They can do so in close partnership with local employers and, yes, private providers.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Broward College in Florida offers one promising model. It has built industry certifications into its curriculum, along with internships and other work-based learning opportunities provided by local employers. This program was made possible by the U.S. Department of Labor's Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training program, which funded the development of thousands of similar efforts as part of the 2009 economic stimulus package.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   A scaled-up version of the career training program, which spent $1.9 billion to fund work-based learning credentials for more than 350,000 students, could stimulate local economies that have been hit hardest by the pandemic.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   In a separate initiative, Google has partnered with more than 100 community colleges to offer training in information technology support careers. Collaborations like this combine private sector innovation and responsiveness to market demand with the support system and local knowledge of community colleges. While such public-private partnerships raise governance concerns, these can be addressed with full disclosure of financial arrangements and careful monitoring of metrics like graduation rates and post-program earnings.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The lesson is clear. In the aftermath of the Great Recession, the United States outsourced job training to for-profit colleges, and many students are still suffering the consequences. Community colleges need to be at the center of talent development for millions of American workers.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 In the right hands, location data can be a force for good. It can provide publishers and app developers with advertising revenue so consumers can access free services and information. It can inform city planning, help ride-sharing users reach their destinations, guide travelers to great local spots, reassure parents their children are safely on their way home, remind people where they parked their car and relieve traffic 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 congestion
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone . And it has immense potential for the future: in autonomous driving, augmented reality, smarter health care interventions and context-aware artificial intelligence.
\f3\fs24 \

\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 But location data can also be abused. Bounty hunters were able to buy the current location of a cellphone for $300, Vice 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 reported
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , because telecom companies sold the real-time location of phones to shady companies. And apps that track location data may turn around and sell that data, revealing someone\'92s every movement \'97 whether it is to a retail store, an abortion clinic or a gay bar. Bloomberg Businessweek       \'a0    
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 recently reported
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  on a company with thousands of cameras selling car locations to debt collectors and others; there is no \'93opt-in\'94 involved, and it\'92s illegal in all states to cover your license plate.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 There are no formal rules for what is ethical \'97 or even legal \'97 in the location data business. We could all take a Hippocratic oath for 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  (as in medicine: \'93First do no harm\'94), and hope that living by such an oath would curb abuses. But even in the best of circumstances, that oath is voluntary.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It\'92s time for Congress to regulate the industry.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Foursquare, where I serve as chief executive, is one of the largest independent companies in the location technology industry. We started with a consumer app that invented the check-in to allow people to find friends and learn more about the cities they explore. Today our customers are mainly businesses \'97 including over 150,000 registered app developers and more than half of the Fortune 100 companies \'97 that rely on mapping technology and consumer insights that our location platform makes possible.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In our consumer apps, we try to set an example with transparent opt-in consent language \'97 plain words up front, not buried in some long privacy policy. When we share our technology with other apps, we only work with reputable partners. When we acquire data sets, we contractually mandate that our partner\'92s data is collected with opt-in consent. But all of this is purely optional across the industry. That\'92s a recipe for abuse.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 America needs more. We believe federal regulation that enforces three core principles will prevent abuses.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 First, apps on mobile devices should not be allowed to ask for location data unless they offer the user a clear service that depends on that data. Why, for example, should a flashlight app have your location data? Value can come in many forms \'97 localized content and offers, better alerts, coupons for certain retailers and even direct compensation (rewards for participating in a location-based survey, for instance). The app should make the proposition clear to the consumer \'97 that is, it should state that the app is providing an experience enhanced by location, and make that \'93enhancement\'94 known.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Second, a new privacy law must require greater transparency around what consumers are signing up for and how their data will be used. (We have found that around half of consumers are likely to opt-in when given a clear idea of what they are agreeing to.) Permission to collect or share data should be spelled-out in plain English, not buried within terms and conditions. These permission pop-ups must explain concisely how data will be used and whether it will be shared with partners. Lawmakers must also require apps that are collecting data to make it easy for users to opt-out at any time (under the condition that they won\'92t get personalized content as a result). Consumers, not companies, should control the process.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Third, a privacy law must establish the obligation and duty on those collecting location data (even with consent) to \'93do no harm.\'94 It must require companies to apply privacy-protecting measures to all data uses. The industry needs to earn consumer trust and speak to what makes consumers anxious.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 A Hippocratic oath for 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone , akin to the 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 fiduciary
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  duty the Securities and Exchange Commission applies to investment advisers, might be the right model. Companies should have to respect restricted, sensitive categories like a Planned Parenthood clinic or cancer center. They should also be required to ensure that the data they collect is not used to discriminate based on religion, medical conditions, sexual orientation or political beliefs. This can\'92t be voluntary: A federal regulator would receive complaints and investigate alleged abuses \'97 and be authorized to administer meaningful punishments and fines that are large enough to change behavior, as in the European Union\'92s privacy law, the       \'a0    
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 General Data Protection Regulation
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone .
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 A Hippocratic standard would make it illegal for any location or movement data, even with proper permissions, to be used to gouge consumers or deny them access to basic life services like loans, health care, insurance, employment, civil rights and educational opportunities. This would not prohibit a person from installing a car tracker to earn a \'93good driver\'94 discount. But family tracking apps should not secretly be used to hike your teenager\'92s auto insurance above normal rates by monitoring driving speeds.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Moreover, all location companies should be required to protect consumer data with appropriate security steps, and blur or minimize data sharing in ways to enhance privacy. For instance, Foursquare does not want to see a future where people\'92s full \'93location trails\'94 (the exact names of places visited and exact times a person moves through them reconstructed to form a daily journey) are widely accessible to every advertiser or government agency, without any safeguards. That\'92s too intrusive and completely unnecessary for us all to benefit from the value of location. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Not all location data is the same. When we work with partners who want to understand if marketing is leading more people to visit their stores, or to identify consumers who frequent rival chains to try to win them over, we use only pseudonymized identifiers and blur out precise data. That means we don\'92t share the specific time of a visit to a specific location. Nor do we offer details on all visits for any particular user over the course of a day.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The idea is that whatever we share, the data is sufficiently general so that no individual can be picked out and \'93watched,\'94 or it\'92s entirely abstracted into interest-based audiences (such as \'93moms in the United States who shop at Whole Foods and prefer yoga studios\'94 or \'93college students who frequent fast food\'94).There\'92s no reason that every company in our industry couldn\'92t adopt the same practices, and regulation should force them to.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 These steps are necessary, but they\'92re not sufficient. Companies should have to maintain data with adequate security protections, including encryption at rest and in transit. Employees at companies that collect data on millions of consumers should undergo privacy and ethics training. Companies should require clients and other people who use the data to promise that they will not use the tech and data for unethical or discriminatory practices \'97 and should penalize those that act unethically. Regulation should force companies to create ethics committees where management and employees must discuss their privacy and ethical data use policies regularly.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Congress should legislate now, as some states have. But as with any regulation, there\'92s a chance that Congress could, with the best of intentions, do great damage. Any reform that is overly burdensome on smaller companies, for instance, will only strengthen behemoths like Google and Facebook, putting challengers out of business and reducing innovation.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Doing these things takes time, money and commitment. They may also not be foolproof. Standards evolve, and every company in our industry needs to continually improve their practices to keep up. There\'92s no good reason that companies won\'92t be able to comply with reasonable regulation. Comprehensive regulation will support future innovation, weed out the bad companies and earn the public trust. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Now is the time for Congress to act.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 DALLAS -- Thirty-four years ago, Kevin Stephenson got his younger brother, Randall, a job with the telephone company.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Kevin, then 23, and Randall, 22, had tried selling cattle feed with their father near their home in Moore, Okla., but that didn't pan out. Kevin was hired to do accounting at a local Southwestern Bell office. Randall, who was in college, needed a bit more help. ''He had trouble getting hired,'' Kevin said. ''I talked to someone I knew in personnel.'' 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The brothers had different tastes. Kevin liked to be outside, and now, at 57 years old, he works in Norman, Okla., fixing the decades-old copper lines that still connect to landline telephones in most homes as well as to modern Internet conduits like high-speed fiber optics. Randall liked numbers and stayed indoors, rising through the management ranks.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Southwestern Bell became SBC Communications and took on the old AT&T name through an acquisition in 2005. By 2007, Randall was running the place.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Today, Randall Stephenson, AT&T's chairman and chief executive, is trying to reinvent the company so it can compete more deftly. Not that long ago it had to fight for business with other phone companies and cellular carriers. Then the Internet and cloud computing came along, and AT&T found itself in a tussle with a whole bunch of companies.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   AT&T's competitors are not just Verizon and Sprint, but also tech giants like Amazon and Google. For the company to survive in this environment, Mr. Stephenson needs to retrain its 280,000 employees so they can improve their coding skills, or learn them, and make quick business decisions based on a fire hose of data coming into the company.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   In an ambitious corporate education program that started about two years ago, he is offering to pay for classes (at least some of them) to help employees modernize their skills. But there's a catch: They have to take these classes on their own time and sometimes pay for them with their own money.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   To Mr. Stephenson, it should be an easy choice for most workers: Learn new skills or find your career choices are very limited.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''There is a need to retool yourself, and you should not expect to stop,'' he said in a recent interview at AT&T's Dallas headquarters. People who do not spend five to 10 hours a week in online learning, he added, ''will obsolete themselves with the technology.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Kevin? He admires his younger brother, but he is among the many AT&T lifers who are not that keen to participate in this reinvention of old Ma Bell. ''I'm riding the copper train all the way down,'' he said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   He talks about the changes with obvious affection for both his brother and his longtime employer. In interviews, many veteran AT&T employees around the country showed a surprising amount of emotion toward a company that has been broken up, rebuilt and reinvented several times.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   But that doesn't mean everyone is particularly eager to rebuild and reinvent themselves for a new AT&T. Even if it means, as Randall put it, obsolescence.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Companies' reinventing themselves to compete with more nimble competitors is hardly a new story. Many have tried, and a handful have even succeeded. Mr. Stephenson wants AT&T to be among those few.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   In the last three years, he has spent more than $20 billion annually, primarily on building the digital business. DirecTV was acquired in a $63 billion deal last year, and several billion more was spent to buy wireless businesses in Mexico and the United States. Even for a company with $147 billion in 2015 revenue and over $400 billion in assets built up over more than a century, it's a lot.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   By 2020, Mr. Stephenson hopes AT&T will be well into its transformation into a computing company that manages all sorts of digital things: phones, satellite television and huge volumes of data, all sorted through software managed in the cloud.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   That can't happen unless at least some of his work force is retrained to deal with the technology. It's not a young group: The average tenure at AT&T is 12 years, or 22 years if you don't count the people working in call centers. And many employees don't have experience writing open-source software or casually analyzing terabytes of customer data.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   If you don't develop the new skills, you won't be fired -- at least AT&T won't say as much -- but you won't have much of a future. The company isn't too worried about people leaving, since executives estimate that eventually AT&T could get by with one-third fewer workers.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mr. Stephenson declined to project how many workers he might have by 2020, when the cloud-based system is supposed to be fully in place. One thing about cutting people in an aging work force, he noted, is that ''demography is on our side.'' Other senior executives say shrinking the work force by 30 percent is not out of the question.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Maybe so, but count Kevin among the skeptics of how fast AT&T's transformation will happen.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''I'm proud of my brother,'' he said, ''but he's not going to get rid of this stuff as fast as he thinks.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Eyes on the Cloud
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Long ago, a phone system created wire lines between callers, and operators moved plugs in their switchboards to connect people. Over time, that was automated to become something closer to a computer, with digital fibers and wireless towers. Much of the setup, however, still needed lots of people to tend hardware that had been built for particular tasks, like feeding one neighborhood's calls into a nationwide backbone of wires, fiber and switches.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mr. Stephenson has concentrated on things related to cloud computing, a technology setup that is more like the computer guts of Google or Amazon than the circuits and switches of a phone company. This cloud system will eventually touch ventures in landline phones, wireless, high-speed online services, cable TV and now satellite, thanks to the DirecTV purchase.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Analysts give him good marks but say he has a long way to go. ''They want to be 75 percent done by 2020, and last year they did the first 5 percent,'' said Akshay Sharma, an analyst with the research firm Gartner.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Google and Amazon are increasingly in businesses that look like what AT&T does, and they thrive on analyzing the data they gather about customers. Google, for example, is offering high-speed Internet access in some cities. Amazon is selling video entertainment, as well as hosting new kinds of phone systems in its cloud.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   AT&T wants to build products and services as fast as this competition. Data from satellite TV could be analyzed for viewing habits and someday used, for example, to sell football fans a replay app for their AT&T mobile phones.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   In 2012, Mr. Stephenson realized, much to his dismay, that his staff was woefully unschooled for the new technology. Vision 2020, as the company calls it, is a program that combines online and classroom-based course work in subjects like digital networking and 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone , as well as a look at old skills that can be transferred to new careers.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Everything at AT&T is changing, from the services customers are offered to the way they are charged for them. One service called Network on Demand, for example, allows customers to increase the size of their Internet pipes without calling a technician, something that used to take weeks. And Mr. Stephenson's employees have to be able to deal with all that.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''If we can't do it, mark my words, in three years we'll be managing decline,'' he said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   A possible answer showed up on a sweltering Dallas afternoon in 2012 when Sebastian Thrun arrived. Mr. Thrun, a Silicon Valley technologist and onetime Stanford professor, is known for his futuristic work on self-driving cars and Internet-based learning. He is also the founder of Udacity, an online education company.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Inside a glass-walled office where Mr. Stephenson meets presidential candidates and corporate titans, Mr. Thrun gave him a pitch on funding an online master's degree in engineering that Udacity proposed to teach in conjunction with the Georgia Institute of Technology. Within five minutes, the two men were cross-legged on the floor, Mr. Stephenson eager to try a physics course.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   His first online learning began with an unexpected challenge: getting online. AT&T's own Wi-Fi was too clunky, Mr. Thrun recalled. Eventually they used Mr. Thrun's smartphone, which ran on the network of T-Mobile, a rival carrier.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The building's Wi-Fi is now said to be better, and elsewhere in AT&T the first employees are getting their online Georgia Tech degrees.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Eboni Bell, 24, a product manager for smartphone software in AT&T's Atlanta office, sees the Vision 2020 retraining as the chance of a lifetime. The company provided tuition assistance for much of her two-year Udacity/Georgia Tech master's degree in computer science, which it says cost $6,600. Single and childless, she doesn't mind the hours it takes.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''I leave the office at 7 p.m., work at home until midnight, and Saturdays and Sundays are committed to school,'' she said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Ms. Bell, who wants to work in software architecture and design, plans to keep taking courses. ''I need to know what my competitors are doing,'' she said. ''I can't see myself staying with one product too long -- it makes me feel like I'm not growing.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   So far most of the people who have taken the new courses are managers, and seem interested in learning very technical skills. Among the most popular courses are web development, data analysis, introduction to programming and writing apps for the iPhone.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''It's great for those who want to make the transition,'' said Mr. Sharma of Gartner. ''If you don't want to change, it's a good time to retire and enjoy life.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   AT&T's workers receive weekly emails and video broadcasts about learning online. Vision 2020 includes an internal website where employees can enter their job titles, see what types of careers might be available in a software-driven company, and what courses they need to take to get them. Over time, their grades are logged, and depending on how they do on the schoolwork, different new courses are suggested. Eventually, performance reviews will include data on what people studied, how well they did and whether, like Ms. Bell, they are willing to keep learning.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Eventually, the plan is that desire for learning will be taken into account when promotions are considered.

\f2\fs20   Across the country in Orange, Calif., Patti Cunningham, a 61-year-old technician, is struggling. Ms. Cunningham, who has worked at AT&T for 43 years, has not signed up for any courses, and can barely recall receiving emails about the new plans. (An AT&T spokesman produced dozens of such messages, going back to early 2014.) Essentially, she does not see a place for herself.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''This new concept of training on your own time, everything changing all the time, if you want to keep working, do more things on your own time -- I guess they have to do it,'' she said, sitting in a run-down room at her union local. ''But I don't see a need to be involved.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Christopher Shelton, national head of the Communications Workers of America, said the changes were inevitable, and he believed his people would go along with them.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''We realized a long time ago that you can't fight technology change and win,'' he said. ''Our contracts spell out training programs and policies to make sure that members get training to update their skills as technology changes.'' Still, he thinks the expectations about home study after a hard day's work are too much.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   AT&T will reimburse up to $8,000 a year in tuition; the amount was raised just last month. The company claims that a year into the program, over half of the work force, mostly managers, has started training, sometimes with dozens of short online courses.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''People are going to have to work hard, but it's not insane,'' said William Blase, who oversees personnel for all of AT&T. ''There's going to be an expectation that your compensation will be tied to continuing to learn. We're at a crossroads as a business -- and a country -- where education has to keep up with technology.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   If there is one thing on which Ms. Bell and Ms. Cunningham agree, albeit with different sentiments, it is that the change is necessary. Eventually phone calls, texts, sensor data and TV shows, along with much else, will all run on fiber-optic networks and be managed largely with software.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Ms. Bell works with a lot of older colleagues. ''One of my co-workers has been looking at the same database for 20 years,'' she said. ''It sounds harsh, but if she doesn't adapt, there won't be room for her.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   That message has not been lost on Jacobie Davis, an 18-year employee in Richardson, Tex., who works in tech support for older-style gear. At 39, he is the youngest person in his office, and is scrambling to study both new networks and 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone . ''I try to put in 15 hours a week,'' he said. ''By 2020, my technology will be gone.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   For Some, a Tough Sell
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   In some ways, cloud computing is not as radical a technology shift as all the puffy language suggests. Big banks of computers still run software, as they have been doing in many industries since the 1960s. They have more power, because their chips have more transistors that enable them to do more, and they connect to more things thanks to fiber-optic cable and wireless.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The big difference is something called virtualization, which amounts to software that allows many machines to operate like one piece of computer hardware. This made it possible to run software that in effect interacted with other software instead of hardware. This, in turn, means the possibility of changing functions around rapidly by typing a few lines of code.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The new systems also collect more data, quickly analyze information about what people and things are doing, and react. That is how online ads are personalized for you, and increasingly how maps reflect current traffic conditions, or streetlights adjust to suit parking congestion.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Now what once took a year of analysis and deployment can instead happen in days, even minutes.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   These concepts can be tough in some reaches of AT&T, where lives and work have not changed all that much.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   In Dayton, Ohio, Kirk Warrenburg came out of a job in a bowling alley and started wiring cards for telegraph systems 40 years ago. Now he works on AT&T's signaling network, which makes sure billions of calls get through.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   He has taken 16 courses -- Udacity courses and in-house ''nano courses,'' each about two weeks long -- in the last year. He doesn't see himself changing jobs, however, because the old machines still need someone to care for them. Younger workers, he thinks, won't want to be in his dead end.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Writing a telegraph circuit was like writing a recipe for a field technician,'' he said. ''A lot of legacy systems are still around here. I'll be long gone before they will.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Some other older employees besides Kevin Stephenson think the 2020 target will come and go, but basics won't change.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The 2020 effort ''is just a start,'' said Kenny Williams, 64, a testing technician and the head of Ms. Cunningham's union local in Southern California. ''I've inoculated my people against worrying. They need a fiber network for this that doesn't exist out here yet. Seventy percent of my folks are safe; the other 30 have to be found jobs, or they'll take the golden handshake'' and retire.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   As he sees it, much of the urgency comes from the threat of Google. In 2015 Google Fiber, Google's high-speed Internet service, caused AT&T to do something uncommon in its history: lower its prices because of competition. ''In 40 years here I hadn't seen that,'' Mr. Williams said. ''Their people aren't in unions -- we're a lot more on AT&T's side than theirs.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   AT&T recently began rolling out fiber in about 50 cities in the United States, in what it hopes is a bigger move than Google can make. Still, putting a cloud system all the way across a diverse, continentwide network will take years, which is why Mr. Williams feels safe.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Face to Face With Google
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   What happens next at AT&T -- and how fast that will happen -- is a matter of disagreement in the Stephenson family.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''I go out to houses away from the cities, and there's not a lot of fiber there,'' Kevin said. Fiber would open the way for all that new technology. He takes comfort in looking at patches linemen did on fiber systems decades ago -- from both the jury-rigged craftsmanship and the way they have endured.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   But Randall said his brother was not necessarily like the rest of the work force because there will always be hard, outdoor tasks for people like him. ''There will be people turning screws and digging trenches. I'll be long gone before that is over. But other guys I know in Oklahoma will do a skills pivot'' with additional training, he said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Besides, it's not just about his brother. It's about most of the economy.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Everybody is going to go face to face with a Google, an Amazon, a Netflix,'' he said. ''You compete based on data, and based on customer insights you get with their permission. If we're wrong, it won't play well for anyone here.''

\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Hillary Clinton
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone \'92s win was assured because some of the forecasts lacked context explaining potentially wide margins of error.\

\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Dr. Pradeep Mutalik
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , a research scientist at the Yale Center for Medical Informatics, who had calculated that some of the vote models could be off by 15 to 20 percent.\

\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 The election prediction business is one small aspect of a far-reaching change across industries that have increasingly become obsessed with data, the value of it and the potential to mine it for cost-saving and profit-making insights. It is a behind-the-scenes technology that quietly drives everything from the ads that people see online to billion-dollar acquisition deals.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Examples stretch from Silicon Valley to the industrial heartland. Microsoft, for example, is paying $26 billion for LinkedIn largely 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 for its database
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  of personal profiles and business connections on more than 400 million people. General Electric, the nation\'92s largest manufacturer, is betting big that       \'a0    
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 data-generating sensors
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  and software can increase the efficiency and profitability of its jet engines and other machinery.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 But 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  is a technology advance with trade-offs. It can see things as never before, but also can be a blunt instrument, missing context and nuance. All kinds of companies and institutions use data quietly and behind the scenes to make predictions about human behavior. But only occasionally \'97 as with Tuesday\'92s election results \'97 do consumers get a glimpse of how these formulas work and the extent to which they can go wrong.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Google Flu Trends for instance, looked to be a triumph of big data prescience, tracking flu outbreaks based on trends in flu-related search terms. But in the 2012-13 flu season it greatly 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 overstated the number of cases
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone .\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 This year, Facebook\'92s algorithm took down the image, posted by a Norwegian author, of a naked 9-year-old girl fleeing napalm bombs. The software code saw a violation of the social network\'92s policy prohibiting child pornography, not an iconic photo of the Vietnam War and human suffering.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 And a Microsoft chat bot, intended to learn \'93conversational understanding\'94 by mining online text, was quickly retired this year after its machine-learning algorithm began 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 generating racist comments
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone .\
Even well-meaning attempts to harness data analysis for the greater good can backfire. Two years ago, the Samaritans, a suicide-prevention group in Britain, developed a free app to notify people whenever someone they followed on Twitter posted potentially suicidal phrases like \'93hate myself\'94 or \'93tired of being alone.\'94 The group quickly 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 removed the app
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  after complaints from people who warned that it could be misused to harass users at their most vulnerable moments.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 This week\'92s failed election predictions suggest that the rush to exploit data may have outstripped the ability to recognize its limits.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \'93State polls were off in a way that has not been seen in previous presidential election years,\'94 said Sam Wang, a neuroscience professor at 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Princeton University
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  who is a co-founder of the Princeton Election Consortium. He speculated that polls may have failed to capture Republican loyalists who initially vowed not to vote for Mr. Trump, but changed their minds in the voting booth.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Beyond election night, there are broader lessons that raise questions about the rush to embrace data-driven decision-making across the economy and society.\
The enthusiasm for big data has been fueled by the success stories of Silicon Valley giants born on the internet, like Google, Amazon and Facebook. The digital powerhouses harvest vast amounts of user data using clever software for search, social networks and online commerce. Data is the fuel, and algorithms borrowed from the tool kit of artificial intelligence, notably machine learning, are the engine.\
The early commercial use for the technology has been to improve the odds of making a sale \'97 through targeted ads, personalized marketing and product recommendations. But big-data decision-making is increasingly being embraced in every industry, and to make higher-stakes decisions that crucially affect people\'92s lives \'97 like helping to make medical diagnoses, hiring choices and loan approvals.\
The danger, data experts say, lies in trusting the data analysis too much without grasping its limitations and the potentially flawed assumptions of the people who build predictive models.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 The technology can be, and is, enormously useful. \'93But the key thing to understand is that 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  is a tool that is not necessarily going to give you answers, but probabilities,\'94 said 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Erik Brynjolfsson
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , a professor at the Sloan School of Management at the       \'a0    
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Massachusetts Institute of Technology
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone .\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Mr. Brynjolfsson said that people often do not understand that if the chance that something will happen is 70 percent, that means there is a 30 percent chance it will not occur. The election performance, he said, is \'93not really a shock to 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  and statistics. It\'92s how it works.\'94\
So, what happened with the election data and algorithms? The answer, it seems, is a combination of the shortcomings of polling, analysis and interpretation, perhaps both in how the numbers were presented and how they were understood by the public.\
Mr. Silver, the founder of FiveThirtyEight, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Amanda Cox, the editor of The Upshot, and Mr. Wang of the Princeton Election Consortium said state polling errors were largely to blame for the underestimates of Mr. Trump\'92s chances of winning.\
In addition to the polling errors, data scientists said the inherent weakness of election models might have caused some forecasting errors. Before an election, forecasters use a combination of historical polls and recent polling data to predict a candidate\'92s chance of winning. Some may also factor in other variables, such as giving higher weight to a candidate who is an incumbent.\
But even with decades of polls to analyze, it is difficult for forecasters to predict accurately a candidate\'92s chance of winning the presidency months or even weeks ahead of time. Dr. Mutalik of Yale compared election modeling to weather forecasting.\
\'93Even with the best models, it is difficult to predict the weather more than 10 days out because there are so many small changes that can cause big changes,\'94 Dr. Mutalik said. \'93In mathematics, this is known as chaos.\'94\
But, unlike weather prediction, current election models tend to take into account only several decades\'92 worth of data. And changing the parameters of that data set can also significantly affect calculations.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 The FiveThirtyEight model, for instance, is calibrated based on general elections since 1972, a year when state polling began to increase. On Oct. 24, that model put Mrs. Clinton\'92s chances of winning at 85 percent. But when the site experimentally recalibrated the model based on more recent polls, dating back just to 2000, Mrs. Clinton\'92s chances rose to 95 percent, 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Mr. Silver wrote on his blog
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone .\
In this presidential election, analysts said, the other big problem was that some state polls were wrong. Recent 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 polls from Wisconsin
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , for instance, put Mrs. Clinton well ahead of Mr. Trump. And election forecasts relied on that information for their predictions. Britain encountered similar lapses when polls mistakenly predicted that the nation would vote in June to stay in the European Union.\
\'93If we could go back to the world of reporting being about the candidates and the parties and the issues at stake instead of the incessant coverage of every little blip in the polls, we would all be better off,\'94 said 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Thomas E. Mann
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , an election expert at the Brookings Institution. \'93They are addictive, and it takes the eye off the ball.\'94\

\f2\fs20 With tensions swirling between the United States and China, along with the complexities of running a social media company, any large acquisition appeared too treacherous to navigate. So Microsoft discussed taking a small stake in

\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Even a small deal would be a win-win, the thinking went.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 For Microsoft, a minority investment would potentially bring TikTok over to using its 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Azure cloud computing service
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , immediately making the app one of Microsoft\'92s biggest cloud clients, said the people, who declined to be identified because the details are confidential. (TikTok has been using Google\'92s cloud computing services to power its videos.)
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f4\i\fs20 \cf2 \ul \ulc2 For ByteDance
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  and TikTok, a deal with Microsoft could help propel the valuation of the app\'92s business outside China to as high as $80 billion, the people said. It would also provide TikTok with the endorsement of a blue-chip American company to mollify the Trump administration, which had called 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 TikTok\'92s
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  Chinese ties a national security threat.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Yet what started as discussions about a small investment morphed into a big, messy, political soap opera. Pushed by President Trump, who has ordered TikTok\'92s U.S. operations to be sold or to cease operating, ByteDance is now discussing selling parts of TikTok\'92s global operations to several potential bidders. And with so many groups jumping into the talks to get a piece of any deal, all are trying to drive their own interests and agendas.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Apart from Microsoft, the bidders 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 include Oracle
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , the enterprise software company, the people with knowledge of the talks said. Bankers and investors, some authorized and some simply trying to gin up a deal, have also called Netflix and Twitter  about buying TikTok, they said, though it is unclear if those companies have a genuine interest in an acquisition. Microsoft, with the deepest resources and a market value of more than $1.6 trillion, still appears the furthest along for now, the people said.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The sale scenarios on the table are head-spinning, the people said, because all of the parties \'97 ByteDance, TikTok, their investors, and the bidders \'97 want to get the most out of any deal. The talks have covered everything from selling just TikTok\'92s North American operations all the way to every part of TikTok, minus ByteDance\'92s Chinese-only video app Douyin, they said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 A deal price is unclear, though numbers have ranged from $20 billion to $50 billion depending on what parts of TikTok will be sold, the people said. The talks are fluid and no deal may ultimately be reached.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Even if one does take place, a TikTok sale \'97 which has become a referendum on the U.S.-China relationship \'97 may still be disrupted if Beijing or Mr. Trump weigh in. Mr. Trump has been highly involved, including talking to Microsoft\'92s chief executive, Satya Nadella, and saying that Oracle could handle buying TikTok. In an 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Aug. 6 executive order
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , he imposed a deadline for TikTok\'92s U.S. operations to be sold by Sept. 15.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 On Monday, 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 TikTok sued the U.S. government
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , arguing that the executive order had deprived it of due process. The suit could give TikTok more time to operate in the United States if the courts order it, a stalling tactic that may help the app wait it out past the Nov. 3 election.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Steven Davidoff Solomon, a law professor at the University of California in Berkeley, who contributes to The New York Times, said the United States\'92 forcing such a huge company to sell itself was \'93really unprecedented.\'94 He added, \'93This is a forced sale, and ByteDance is trying to keep it from being as much of a fire sale as possible.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This account of TikTok\'92s deal discussions was based on interviews with more than a dozen people who were involved in or were briefed on the situation. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Representatives from TikTok and ByteDance, Microsoft, Netflix, Twitter, Oracle and the White House declined to comment.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 A spokesman for China\'92s Foreign Ministry, Wang Wenbin, called Mr. Trump\'92s executive order a \'93naked act of bullying,\'94 and added that the U.S. government would eventually \'93reap what it sows.\'94
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 TikTok, which ByteDance created partly out of a $1 billion 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 purchase of the lip-syncing app Musical.ly in 2017
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , has become a phenomenon in the United States and elsewhere. More than 100 million Americans regularly use the app, the company has said, especially teenagers and twentysomethings.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Last year, as tensions between the United States and China grew worse, the Trump administration began scrutinizing TikTok and ByteDance. In November, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a powerful panel known as Cfius that reviews foreign acquisitions, 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 opened an inquiry into ByteDance\'92s deal
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  to buy Musical.ly after lawmakers voiced concerns that TikTok was giving data on its American users to Beijing.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 TikTok has denied that it helps Beijing. To reduce the U.S. pressure, Zhang Yiming, ByteDance\'92s chief executive, began consulting with a small group of investors in his internet company, including Sequoia Capital and General Atlantic. ByteDance, which is privately held, has been valued at about $100 billion.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Doug Leone, one of Sequoia\'92s partners, and Bill Ford, chief executive of General Atlantic, became Mr. Zhang\'92s bridge to the White House, the people with knowledge of the talks said. In their conversations, the Trump administration had specific stipulations: First, it wanted TikTok to overhaul its governance and shareholder structure to 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 reduce ByteDance\'92s
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone ownership of the app. Second, it wanted guarantees that TikTok\'92s American user data be stored on U.S. servers.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The firms needed a major U.S. tech partner to get the deal done, the people close to the talks said. Mr. Zhang and the investors figured that Facebook, Google and Amazon were under too much antitrust scrutiny. But Microsoft, with its cash hoard of $137 billion, cloud expertise and 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 strong government relationships
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , could work.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Mr. Zhang, a former Microsoft engineer, reached out to Microsoft executives to gauge their interest, said one person with knowledge of the talks. Sequoia and General Atlantic declined to comment.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 By July, Microsoft joined the talks. At the time, the discussions centered on Microsoft making a minority investment in TikTok, the people said. Between the U.S.-China tensions and the pressures of operating a social media company, Microsoft executives were hesitant about a big deal, said people briefed on the conversations. ByteDance and Mr. Zhang also wanted to retain some ownership of TikTok, they said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Yet as the talks progressed, Microsoft grew warmer on a potentially larger deal with TikTok. While Microsoft has lots of data about industries like gaming and workplace software, it has little information about people\'92s social media behavior. TikTok\'92s user interaction information could strengthen Microsoft\'92s 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  operation, the people briefed on the talks said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 TikTok could also be linked to Microsoft\'92s $7 billion advertising business. Together, that could make a meaningful difference to Microsoft\'92s growth, they said.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 ByteDance and Microsoft came to see an acquisition of TikTok\'92s U.S. operations as a cleaner option, they added. Microsoft could allow TikTok to operate as a stand-alone unit, similar to how it had treated past large acquisitions, such as its $2.5 billion acquisition of the 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 company behind the video game Minecraft
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  in 2014 and its $26 billion purchase of 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 professional networking site LinkedIn
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  in 2016.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 All the while, Trump administration officials were keeping an eye on the situation. Last month, 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , who is chairman of Cfius and holds the final word on the panel\'92s recommendations of ByteDance\'92s purchase of Musical.ly, spoke with TikTok and Microsoft about how TikTok\'92s data should be on U.S. servers, three of the people said.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 On July 31, Mr. Mnuchin presented the Cfius analysis of the ByteDance-Musical.ly deal to Mr. Trump, two people said. The recommendation: that ByteDance be ordered to sell TikTok to an American owner, with Microsoft acquiring most of TikTok\'92s business and the stakes held by ByteDance\'92s Chinese shareholders winnowed to a minority investment.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 A spokesman for the Treasury and Mr. Mnuchin declined to comment.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 But aboard Air Force One later that day, President Trump said he planned to ban TikTok entirely. Several of Mr. Trump\'92s advisers were furious at the derailment of their recommendation, saying that China hawks like Peter Navarro, the White House director of trade and manufacturing policy, had exerted too much influence, according to White House officials and others close to the president.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In a statement, Mr. Navarro said, \'93Nobody exerts \'91influence\'92 over President Donald J. Trump. He listens carefully to a wide range of often sharply competing views and then he makes the best and most informed decision. That\'92s why he is such a great president.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The next 72 hours were chaotic. News leaked that Microsoft was in talks to acquire TikTok. Private equity firms and bankers circled. That briefly included Stephen A. Schwarzman, chief executive of the Blackstone Group, said people familiar with the talks. Blackstone declined to comment.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 That weekend, Mr. Trump called Mr. Nadella about TikTok. Mr. Trump said ByteDance had 45 days to complete a sale of TikTok\'92s business in the United States. He added that any deal should help the U.S. government in some way, perhaps in the form of job creation or other economic benefits, or some kind of offering to the Treasury Department.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Privately, officials at Microsoft and TikTok were shocked. The 45-day window put TikTok at a disadvantage in negotiating the best deal. Mr. Trump also seemed to be arguing for \'93tipping the waiter,\'94 essentially offering a percentage of the deal to the Treasury, the people said.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 On Aug. 2, Microsoft 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 issued a statement
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  about its 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 pursuit of TikTok
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  and said it would provide \'93proper economic benefits to the United States, including the United States Treasury.\'94 It did not elaborate on what that meant.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 A few days later, Mr. Trump signed his executive order to block TikTok if it was not sold by mid-September. A week later, he issued another executive order giving 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 ByteDance 90 days
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  to close such a deal.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Since then, other potential suitors have emerged, including Oracle. ByteDance, backed into a corner by the White House, wants the best price for TikTok \'97 and not only from one bidder in Microsoft. And sensing ByteDance\'92s weakness, more potential acquirers are kicking the tires on the hot, fast-growing app. All of that may turn off Microsoft from a purchase.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Even as deal discussions have continued, TikTok sued the U.S. government on Monday over Mr. Trump\'92s executive order.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93We far prefer constructive dialogue over litigation,\'94 the company said in a statement. But given the executive order, it said, \'93we simply have no choice.\'94

\f2\fs20 \cf0 SAN FRANCISCO -- When Microsoft began talking this summer with the popular video app TikTok and its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, no one had any intentions of pursuing a blockbuster deal.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 With tensions swirling between the United States and China, along with the complexities of running a social media company, any large acquisition appeared too treacherous to navigate. So Microsoft discussed taking a small stake in TikTok and becoming one of the app's minority investors, said four people briefed on the conversations. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Even a small deal would be a win-win, the thinking went.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   For Microsoft, a minority investment would potentially bring TikTok over to using its Azure cloud computing service, immediately making the app one of Microsoft's biggest cloud clients, said the people, who declined to be identified because the details are confidential. (TikTok has been using Google's cloud computing services to power its videos.)
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   For ByteDance and TikTok, a deal with Microsoft could help propel the valuation of the app's business outside China to as high as $80 billion, the people said. It would also provide TikTok with the endorsement of a blue-chip American company to mollify the Trump administration, which had called TikTok's Chinese ties a national security threat.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Yet what started as discussions about a small investment morphed into a big, messy, political soap opera. Pushed by President Trump, who has ordered TikTok's U.S. operations to be sold or to cease operating, ByteDance is now discussing selling parts of TikTok's global operations to several potential bidders. And with so many groups jumping into the talks to get a piece of any deal, all are trying to drive their own interests and agendas.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Apart from Microsoft, the bidders include Oracle, the enterprise software company, the people with knowledge of the talks said. Bankers and investors, some authorized and some simply trying to gin up a deal, have also called Netflix and Twitter  about buying TikTok, they said, though it is unclear if those companies have a genuine interest in an acquisition. Microsoft, with the deepest resources and a market value of more than $1.6 trillion, still appears the furthest along for now, the people said.

\f2\fs20   A deal price is unclear, though numbers have ranged from $20 billion to $50 billion depending on what parts of TikTok will be sold, the people said. The talks are fluid and no deal may ultimately be reached.

\f2\fs20   A few days later, Mr. Trump signed his executive order to block TikTok if it was not sold by mid-September. A week later, he issued another executive order giving ByteDance 90 days to close such a deal.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Since then, other potential suitors have emerged, including Oracle. ByteDance, backed into a corner by the White House, wants the best price for TikTok -- and not only from one bidder in Microsoft. And sensing ByteDance's weakness, more potential acquirers are kicking the tires on the hot, fast-growing app. All of that may turn off Microsoft from a purchase.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Even as deal discussions have continued, TikTok sued the U.S. government on Monday over Mr. Trump's executive order.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''We far prefer constructive dialogue over litigation,'' the company said in a statement. But given the executive order, it said, ''we simply have no choice.''

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The uproar over an algorithm that lowered the grades of 40 percent of students is a sign of battles to come regarding the use of technology in public services.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 LONDON \'97 Even after a final term with schools closed for the pandemic, Sam Sharpe-Roe was optimistic about the coming school year. Teachers from his West London school had given him grades \'97 three A\'92s and one B \'97 that were strong enough to secure him a spot at his first choice of university next month.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 But after the 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 British government
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  used a 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 computer-generated score
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  to replace exams that were canceled because of the coronavirus, all his grades fell and the college revoked his admission.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Mr. Sharpe-Roe, along with thousands of other students and parents, had received a crude lesson in what can go wrong when a 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 government relies on an algorithm
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  to make important decisions affecting the public.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Experts said the grading scandal was a sign of debates to come as Britain and other countries increasingly use technology to automate public services, arguing that it can make government more efficient and remove human prejudices.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 But critics say the opaque systems often amplify biases that already exist in society and are typically adopted without sufficient debate, faults that were put on clear display in the grading disaster.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Nearly 40 percent of students in England saw their grades reduced after the government re-evaluated the exams, known as A-levels, with the software model. It included in its calculations a school\'92s past performance on the tests and a student\'92s earlier results on \'93mock\'94 exams.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Government officials said the model was meant to make the system more fair, balancing out potentially inflated scores given by some teachers. But students and their parents, particularly those from lower-income areas with struggling schools, were outraged that their futures had been turned over to lines of code that favored students from private schools and wealthy areas.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Even after the government apologized and 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 threw out the computer scores
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , many students had already lost their slots at their preferred universities, sending the admission process into further chaos.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 \'93These algorithms are obviously not correct,\'94 said Mr. Sharpe-Roe, 18, whose home borough of Ealing is enormously diverse but also divided by race, ethnicity and income. \'93I know a load of other people who are in a similar situation.\'94
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The outcome, experts say, was entirely predictable. In fact, the Royal Statistical Society had 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 for months
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  warned the test administration agency, Ofqual, that the model was flawed.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 \'93It\'92s government trying to emulate Silicon Valley,\'94 said Christiaan van Veen, director of the digital welfare state and human rights project at New York University. \'93But the public sector is completely different from private companies.\'94
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 As an investigator for the United Nations, Mr. van Veen studies how Britain and other countries use
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 computers to automate social services
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone . He said the techniques were being applied to policing and court sentencing, health care, immigration, social welfare and more. \'93There are no areas of government that are exempt from this trend,\'94 he said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Britain has been particularly aggressive in adopting new technology in government, often with mixed results. Earlier this month, the government said it would stop using an algorithm for weighing visa applications after facing a legal complaint that this was discriminatory. A few days later, a British court 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 ruled against the use
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  of some facial-recognition software by the police.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The country\'92s automated welfare system, Universal Credit, has faced years of criticism, including from the 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 United Nations
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , for making it harder for some citizens to obtain unemployment benefits. Britain\'92s contact-tracing app, which the government had said would be key to containing the coronavirus, has been delayed by technical problems.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 \'93There is an idea that if it has an algorithm attached to it, it\'92s novel and interesting and different and innovative, without understanding what those things could be doing,\'94 said Rachel Coldicutt, a technology policy expert in London who is working on a book about responsible innovation.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Those who have called for more scrutiny of the British government\'92s use of technology said the testing scandal was a turning point in the debate, a vivid and easy-to-understand example of how software can affect lives.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Cori Crider, a lawyer at Foxglove, a London-based law firm that filed a complaint against the grading algorithm, said the problem was not the use of technology itself but the lack of transparency. Little is known about how the models work before they are introduced.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 \'93There has been a tendency to compute first and ask questions later,\'94 said Ms. Crider, who also brought the 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 legal challenge against the visa algorithm
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone . \'93There\'92s been a refusal to have an actual debate about how these systems work and whether we want them at all.\'94
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 For years, Britain has heralded technology as a way to modernize government and provide social services more efficiently. The trend has spanned several administrations but has been given fresh momentum under Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 His top political adviser, Dominic Cummings, has argued forcefully that Silicon Valley thinking is needed to create 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 high performance government
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , including new workers in areas like 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  and artificial intelligence. He has 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 expressed admiration
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  for the \'93frontiers of the science of prediction.\'94
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 In response to the coronavirus, Britain has sought help from companies like Palantir, a Silicon Valley analytics firm that was hired to manage data for the country\'92s National Health Service. A London-based artificial intelligence firm, Faculty, is working on predictive systems to help track the virus.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In another embarrassing misstep, the government decided to build its own contact-tracing app rather than using technical standards set by Apple and Google, despite warnings that it would have limitations. The release has been delayed for months.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Britain is not alone in turning some decisions over to computer systems. In the United States, 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 algorithms are used by police departments
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  to determine where officers patrol and by courts to set prison sentences. In Spain, the monitoring group Algorithm Watch identified a system being used to predict households at risk of 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 domestic violence
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone . The Netherlands abandoned the use of a system to detect welfare fraud after a judge said it was unlawful.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The techniques are often pitched as apolitical, but researchers say they disproportionately affect lower-income and minority groups. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93One of the great benefits of these tools for governments is it allows them to portray the decisions they are making as neutral and objective, as opposed to moral decisions,\'94 said Virginia Eubanks, an associate professor at the State University of New York at Albany, whose book, \'93Automating Inequity,\'94 explores the topic.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 In Britain, the political fallout of the grading mishap dominated the news and led to calls for the country\'92s education minister to resign. Students

\cf0 One day this fall, Ashutosh Garg, the chief executive of a recruiting service called Eightfold.ai, turned up a r\'e9sum\'e9 that piqued his interest.\
It belonged to a prospective data scientist, someone who unearths patterns in data to help businesses make decisions, like how to target ads. But curiously, the r\'e9sum\'e9 featured the term \'93
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone \'94 nowhere.\
Instead, the r\'e9sum\'e9 belonged to an analyst at Barclays who had done graduate work in physics at the University of California, Los Angeles. Though his profile on the social network LinkedIn indicated that he had never worked as a data scientist, Eightfold\'92s software flagged him as a good fit. He was similar in certain key ways, like his math and computer chops, to four actual data scientists whom Mr. Garg had instructed the software to consider as a model.\
The idea is not to focus on job titles, but \'93what skills they have,\'94 Mr. Garg said. \'93You\'92re really looking for people who have not done it, but can do it.\'94\
The power of such technology will be immediately apparent to any employer scrambling to fill jobs in a tight labor market \'97 not least positions for data scientists, whom companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon are competing to attract.\
Thanks to services like Eightfold, which rely on sophisticated algorithms to match workers and jobs, many employers may soon have access to a universe of prospective workers \'97 even for hard-to-fill roles \'97 whom they might not otherwise have come across.\
And while that could also help some candidates, there\'92s a potential downside for job seekers: Such algorithms may also lower wages in these fields, said Bo Cowgill, an economist at Columbia University who has studied the use of artificial intelligence in hiring.\
\'93You get the more nontraditional, equally qualified, equally high-performing people,\'94 Mr. Cowgill said. But the employer \'93doesn\'92t seem to have to compete for them as much.\'94\
For years, employers and online intermediaries have used algorithms to help fill job openings, but their methods were often crude. A computer would identify key words on r\'e9sum\'e9s, then determine whether those words corresponded to text in job descriptions.\
While this approach can be more efficient than manually searching a site like LinkedIn, it has drawbacks. Applicants can game the process by larding their r\'e9sum\'e9s with terms the machines are likely to be looking for. Conversely, poorly worded job listings could cause computers to overlook qualified candidates.\
But recent advances in a form of artificial intelligence known as deep learning have made the machines used by some companies, like Eightfold and the online job hub ZipRecruiter, far more powerful. Instead of simply scanning words on a page and matching them to words in a job description, a machine can now identify skills and aptitudes that don\'92t explicitly appear on a candidate\'92s r\'e9sum\'e9.\
To illustrate, Mr. Garg points out that about 90 percent of software engineers at the financial software company Intuit in Mountain View, Calif., know the programming language Java, according to data Eightfold has analyzed. That means the machine is on safe ground inferring that an Intuit software engineer knows Java, even if he or she doesn\'92t list the skill on a r\'e9sum\'e9.\
By performing a similar exercise across an entire r\'e9sum\'e9, the company\'92s software can build a detailed profile of a job applicant. It can extract more than the usual amount of information from categories like education (certain disciplines at less prominent universities, like natural-language processing at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, produce high-achieving workers) and even hobbies (chess players tend to be good at coding, basketball players at sales).\
Eightfold, which is based in Silicon Valley, also makes a clever trade with clients: to improve its results, Eightfold asks clients to use its human-resources software, which imports employee data in anonymous form. This includes information on how workers with different backgrounds perform in different jobs, and how much they earn.\
Eightfold can then use this data to better predict performance \'97 say, how well an Intuit software engineer who plays chess and graduated from the University of Massachusetts might do at Amazon or Microsoft.\
Intuit did not respond to a request for comment.\
The software tool can be especially powerful to an employer intent on expanding a search beyond candidates with conventional experience and qualifications. In that case, a recruiter can specify criteria (like industry and location, and even how likely the candidate is to accept an offer) that would turn up less traditional r\'e9sum\'e9s.\
Claudia Villanueva, a recruiting and diversity official at AdRoll Group, which helps clients with digital ads and marketing, said she recently used Eightfold when trying to fill a financial-planning position. The top candidate had experience in industries the tech world often shuns, like manufacturing. But the Eightfold algorithm flagged her as a winner.\
\'93The tech industry sometimes has a hard time moving past tech experience,\'94 Ms. Villanueva said. \'93We keep hiring the same people in the industry. To me this is a really interesting example of how we broke that cycle a bit.\'94\
In the case of the Barclays analyst, Eightfold\'92s software pegged him as a budding data scientist partly because he had a master\'92s degree in statistics and knew computer programming languages like C++ and Matlab, even though he had no apparent background in 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone .\
\'93We have gone ahead and analyzed tens of millions to hundreds of millions of profiles of people to see how people have moved in their career,\'94 Mr. Garg said. \'93You can predict what they\'92re likely to do next very easily.\'94 He conceded that the approach worked less well in new or obscure fields with limited data.\
Steve Goodman, the chief executive of Restless Bandit, another firm that applies artificial intelligence to recruiting, compared the exercise of finding nontraditional candidates to filling a professional sports roster.\
Sports franchises tend to pay far more for free agents who leave their previous team than for players they draft out of college or high school, because the free agents have a record. But if computers were able to predict the performance of draft picks with relative precision, this could change their calculus. The price of free agents might drop, and the price of signing a draft pick would rise. This is, in effect, what software can accomplish using artificial intelligence.\
\'93We surface people we think would be good draft picks,\'94 rather than people doing the same jobs, Mr. Goodman said. \'93This person is a little more junior, but based on their career track, people who look like them are cheaper and better for you.\'94\
Mr. Cowgill, the Columbia economist, said this logic was largely correct, but with one key wrinkle: According to his research, the gains to the less obviously qualified candidates unearthed by machines can be so large that they offset smaller losses to conventional candidates.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 In a technical field like software engineering, for example, a dropout from a no-name university could end up making a 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 very comfortable living
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  after becoming known to employers. But established coders are sufficiently in demand that wages are likely to remain high even as it becomes easier to find alternatives.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 In fields requiring fewer technical skills, on the other hand, wages could fall significantly.\
Consider, say, senior marketing jobs, for which large companies often require a master\'92s degree in business administration. If machines can reliably identify less experienced, less credentialed candidates who are likely to excel, it could depress wages.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \'93You can think of cases in the product market where people thought they needed something special and you really didn\'92t \'97 the commodity, low-cost person took over,\'94 said John Horton, a labor economist at N.Y.U. Think of 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 hand-held video cameras
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  after the proliferation of smartphones.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \'93That could happen in labor markets with the realization that you don\'92t need anything special here,\'94 Mr. Horton said.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 All of this presumes, however, that deep-learning technology is viable for use in recruiting and human resources and could eventually become commonplace. Surveys 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 suggest
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  that only a small minority of companies have adopted these tools, and that even fewer feel prepared to exploit them.\
A 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 recent paper
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  summarizing the findings of a conference at the University of Pennsylvania, involving roughly 20 employers, cited a variety of problems. Among them were the difficulty of measuring employees\'92 performance and the sense of unfairness that workers might feel if a computer were to make hiring, firing and promotion decisions.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Perhaps the greatest concern is a basic methodological point \'97 call it the N.B.A. problem. If you were studying National Basketball Association players to figure out what makes one great, you would find almost no correlation between performance and height. Almost everyone in this rarefied world is taller than average. And those who aren\'92t compensate with other gifts, like unusual speed and athleticism.\
If, on the other hand, you selected people at random from the general population and gauged their basketball potential, you would find that it was highly correlated with height.\
The concern is that machines are, in effect, only studying N.B.A. players \'97 the people who already have jobs at a company, or even the people who sought jobs \'97 not the general population.\
Mr. Cowgill believes there are solutions. He wrote a paper showing that seemingly unqualified applicants whom a company accidentally interviews allow a machine to simulate a crude randomized experiment, helping the company learn more about what makes a good employee.\
But perhaps more telling is that sophisticated technology companies are already using artificial intelligence to help fill jobs. Mr. Garg, who worked as a research scientist at Google for four years, says the company uses such techniques in its recruiting.\
Google says it uses machines to take a second look at r\'e9sum\'e9s in its database that human recruiters may have missed for a limited set of roles.\
The advantage that a vendor like Eightfold has, Mr. Garg asserted, is access to internal data at dozens of other companies, something even Google can\'92t claim. \'93We now can build much deeper models than these companies can build by themselves,\'94 he said.\

\f2\fs20 \cf0 In 2016, Ricardo Lori was an avid user of Talkspace \'97 an app that lets people text and chat with a licensed therapist throughout the day. A part-time actor in New York City, Mr. Lori struggled with depression and anxiety, and he credited the app with helping him get out of an abusive relationship. He was a believer in Talkspace\'92s stated mission to make \'93
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 therapy available and affordable for all
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone ,\'94 and when the start-up offered him a job in its customer support department, Mr. Lori was ecstatic.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Talkspace, which has raised more than $100 million from investors, had an office in the old 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Studio 54
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  building in Midtown Manhattan, with all the usual perks \'97 a Ping-Pong table in the conference room and beer and wine in the company fridge, plus all the therapy employees wanted. \'93I felt like I was at the best place in the world,\'94 Mr. Lori said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 After he 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 wrote
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  a general account of his therapy sessions on the company blog, an executive named Linda Sacco came to Mr. Lori with an intimate request. She wanted to give employees a sense of a typical user\'92s experience. Could she and one of the company\'92s co-founders, Roni Frank, read through two weeks of his therapy chat logs and then share excerpts with the staff?
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Mr. Lori thought about his sessions, which included deeply personal information about his sex life and insecurities. Ms. Sacco assured Mr. Lori that they would keep him anonymous. \'93If I wasn\'92t such a true believer, I probably would have said, \'91Are you nuts?\'92 But I was so enamored of the place,\'94 said Mr. Lori. He agreed.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 At an all-hands meeting on a Friday afternoon in December 2016, employees gathered in a 13th-floor conference room. The Ping-Pong table was folded up so that Ms. Sacco and Ms. Frank could sit on the floor, cross-legged and back-to-back, for a dramatic reading. Ms. Sacco played the role of the therapist; Ms. Frank played a female version of Mr. Lori.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 As Mr. Lori drank a tall glass of red wine and watched, he noticed that a few employees kept glancing his way. Afterward, a member of the marketing department approached and asked if he was OK. Later, Oren Frank, Ms. Frank\'92s husband and the chief executive, thanked him in the elevator. Somehow, word had gotten around that Mr. Lori was the client in the re-enactment.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Mr. Lori began to reconsider whether Talkspace was the dream employer he\'92d imagined \'97 and whether it could be trusted to protect the privacy of its users.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93Everything was done with employee-informed consent,\'94 said Ms. Sacco, who no longer works at Talkspace. John Reilly, a lawyer for Talkspace, said, \'93At the time, the employee expressed great pride over their Talkspace treatment with their therapist, and willingly told multiple co-workers that the transcript was theirs.\'94 Mr. Lori said he did so only after it became clear that his identity was widely known.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Despite the embarrassing episode, Mr. Lori stayed with the company for two more years, until he was let go in 2018. He sued Talkspace for discrimination and wrongful termination, claiming he was told that his anxiety and depression were interfering with his work. The lawsuit settled at the beginning of 2020. Mr. Lori asked the company to take down his blog post; the company didn\'92t, which is part of why Mr. Lori decided to share his story with a reporter.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Mr. Lori and other former Talkspace employees, who asked not to be named for fear of being sued, describe a company with an admirable ambition to destigmatize therapy \'97 but that they say has questionable marketing practices and regards treatment transcripts as another data resource to be mined. Their accounts suggest that the needs of a venture capital-backed start-up to grow quickly can sometimes be in conflict with the core values of professional therapy, including strict confidentiality and patient welfare.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 This year, with a pandemic, a recession and an election shredding Americans\'92 nerves, those concerns are relevant to more people than ever before: In May, Talkspace told The Washington Post that its client base had 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 jumped 65 percent
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  since mid-February.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 \'93The app-ification of mental health care has real problems,\'94 said Hannah Zeavin, a lecturer in the English department at the University of California, Berkeley whose book about teletherapy is scheduled to be published next year by MIT Press. \'93These are corporate platforms first. And they offer therapy second.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93Talkspace has democratized access to therapy and psychiatry by meeting patients where they are in their lives and making treatment more affordable,\'94 said Neil Leibowitz, Talkspace\'92s chief medical officer. \'93The need is profound, especially now in this time of unease, and we are so proud of what our team of therapists is achieving.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Burner phones
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Signing up with Talkspace is quick. Users create an account, fill out a questionnaire, and get a choice of therapists, who work for the platform as 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 independent contractors
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone . Those who sign up for the \'93Unlimited Messaging Therapy Plus\'94 plan, at $260 a month, can send a therapist messages at any time and are promised daily responses. Higher-priced subscription tiers offer \'93live sessions\'94 of 30 minutes. While users can send messages by text, audio and video, Talkspace is known popularly as a platform for texting.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The company was founded in 2011 by Oren and Roni Frank, an Israeli couple who felt inspired after their relationship was \'93
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 saved
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone \'94 by marriage counseling. Mr. Frank had a background in marketing, and Ms. Frank was a software developer.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Ms. Frank is the company\'92s head of clinical services; as of Aug. 6, her LinkedIn page said she had a master\'92s degree in psychoanalysis and psychotherapy from the New York Graduate School of Psychoanalysis, but she never completed the program. The degree claim was deleted after an inquiry from The Times. Mr. Reilly said Ms. Frank \'93studied for an M.A. but left her program before completion to launch Talkspace. Her LinkedIn profile was created while she was studying, the inadvertent error was corrected as soon as the NYT brought this to our attention.\'94 
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The app launched in 2014 to 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 positive press
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  but lukewarm customer reviews, with ratings of about three stars out of five on both the Google and Apple app stores, according to a Times analysis. Users complained about glitchy software and unresponsive therapists.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 In 2015 and 2016, according to four former employees, the company sought to improve its ratings: It asked workers to write positive reviews. One employee said that Talkspace\'92s head of marketing at the time asked him to compile 100 fake reviews in a Google spreadsheet, so that employees could submit them to app stores. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Mr. Lori said that Talkspace gave employees \'93burner\'94 phones to help evade the app stores\'92 techniques for detecting false reviews. \'93They said, \'91Don\'92t do it here. Do it at home. Give us five-star ratings because we have too many bad reviews,\'92\'94 Mr. Lori said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Mr. Reilly, the Talkspace lawyer, disputed this account, saying that employees were free to write reviews any way they liked. \'93We alerted employees if they were to leave a review, to do it from their personal phones \'97 not from the Talkspace office network, as that would cause issues with the app store,\'94 Mr. Reilly said in an emailed statement. \'93To be clear: We have never used fake identities or encouraged anybody to do so; there is no event involving \'91burner\'92 phones, and the idea in and of itself is nonsensical relative to the large number of reviews outstanding.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Mr. Lori still has the iPhone 4 that Talkspace gave him. On the back, there is a white sticker on which someone has written \'93#7 App Store login,\'94 along with a Yahoo email address and password. Two other former employees said burner phones were made available to workers.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93Fake reviews are deceptive to consumers,\'94 said Eric Goldman, co-director of the High Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University. If the Talkspace employees didn\'92t disclose their role when leaving reviews, \'93then the company-encouraged reviews are problematic on multiple legal fronts,\'94 Mr. Goldman said.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Posting fake online reviews is considered a deceptive business practice and can violate laws against false advertising. The 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 New York attorney general
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  and the 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Federal Trade Commission
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  have fined companies for posting such reviews, though consequences can also be less severe. After the F.T.C. accused the cosmetics brand Sunday Riley of posting fake reviews, it simply 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 made the company agree
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  not to do so again.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f4\i\fs20 \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Google
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  and Apple forbid developers from soliciting fraudulent reviews. Apple 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 says
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  violators may have their apps removed from the App Store.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Irreverence unusual to health care
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Talkspace has also seized on moments of national anxiety as opportunities for promotion. On Nov. 9, 2016, the morning after the election of Donald Trump, Mr. Frank 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 wrote on Twitter
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone : \'93Long night in NYC. Woke up this morning to record sales.\'94 The company told reporters that users were flocking to the app to help process the news. CNBC and 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 The Washington Post
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  published stories about Talkspace\'92s \'93
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 7-fold spike in traffic
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone ,\'94 and Mr. Frank 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 shared
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  a Fast Company link claiming a \'937x spike in sales.\'94
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 According to data from two app analytics firms, App Annie and Sensor Tower, the number of Talkspace downloads declined in the months after the election. The Times analyzed more than 3,600 reviews of the Talkspace app. There was no significant increase in the number of reviews, positive or negative, following the 2016 election.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Dr. Leibowitz, Talkspace\'92s chief medical officer, who joined the company in 2018, said in an email: \'93We saw an uptick in use after the election, including, as the piece mentions, an uptick in traffic from existing clients concerned about election results. App analytics fail to capture a few elements: Much of our traffic is on the web.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The Trump election tweets are examples of the sometimes unfiltered social media presence of Mr. Frank and Talkspace \'97\'a0an irreverence familiar among start-ups but unusual among organizations devoted to mental health care.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In 2016, a man named Ross complained on Twitter that the company\'92s subway ads \'93were designed to trigger you into needing their services.\'94 Talkspace\'92s official Twitter account responded, \'93Ads for food make people hungry, right?\'94 and added, \'93I get what you\'92re saying, Ross, but medical professionals need people to buy things.\'94 The company later deleted the messages and blocked the man. (Ross wrote about the exchange in a Medium post; when The Times asked for comment recently, he deleted it and asked that his full name be withheld, citing personal reasons.)
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 From his own Twitter account, Mr. Frank called the man a \'93sweet bored troll\'94 and mocked him for spending $20,000 a year on therapy, saying Talkspace could offer \'93a more affordable alternative.\'94 The company declined to comment about the episode.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'91We need data. All of our data.\'92
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Therapy sessions are incredibly sensitive by their nature \'97 they are intended to be a sacrosanct space for people to confess their secrets and share their deepest vulnerabilities.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Talkspace\'92s website promises users that their conversations will be \'93safe and confidential,\'94 but people may not have as much control as they might think over what happens to their data. Users 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 can\'92t delete
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  their transcripts, for example, because they are considered medical records. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Talkspace\'92s 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 privacy policy
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  states that \'93non-identifying and aggregate information\'94 may be used \'93to better design our website\'94 and \'93in research and trend analysis.\'94 The impression left is a detached and impersonal process. But former employees and therapists told The Times that individual users\'92 anonymized conversations were routinely reviewed and mined for insights.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Karissa Brennan, a New York-based therapist, provided services via Talkspace from 2015 to 2017, including to Mr. Lori. She said that after she provided a client with links to therapy resources outside of Talkspace, a company representative contacted her, saying she should seek to keep her clients inside the app.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93I was like, \'91How do you know I did that?\'92\'94 Ms. Brennan said. \'93They said it was private, but it wasn\'92t.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The company says this would only happen if an algorithmic review flagged the interaction for some reason \'97 for example, if the therapist recommended medical marijuana to a client. Ms. Brennan says that to the best of her recollection, she had sent a link to an anxiety worksheet.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Talkspace also has been analyzing transcripts in order to develop 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 bots
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  that monitor and augment therapists\'92 work. During a presentation in 2019, a Talkspace engineer specializing in machine learning 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 said the research
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  was important because certain cues that a client is in distress that could be caught during in-person sessions might be missed when a therapist is only communicating by text. Software might better catch those cues.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Last year, Mr. Frank wrote 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 an opinion article for The Times
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  encouraging people to make their health data available to researchers. \'93We need data. All of our data. Mine and yours,\'94 he wrote, arguing that analysis of anonymous data sets could improve treatment.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The anonymous data Talkspace collects is not used just for medical advancements; it\'92s used to better sell Talkspace\'92s product. Two former employees said the company\'92s data scientists shared common phrases from clients\'92 transcripts with the marketing team so that it could better target potential customers.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The company disputes this. \'93We are a data-focused company, and 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  and clinical leadership will from time to time share insights with their colleagues,\'94 Mr. Reilly said. \'93This can include evaluating critical information that can help us improve best practices.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 He added: \'93It never has and never will be used for marketing purposes.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'91Engagement\'92-based therapy
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Many licensed therapists sign up with Talkspace for reasons similar to why drivers work for Uber. The company provides a steady stream of clients, takes care of administrative tasks and deals with some insurance issues.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93The beauty of text-based therapy is we are meeting clients where they are, and giving them access to something different,\'94 said Reshawna Chapple, a Talkspace therapist whom the company made available for an interview. \'93It\'92s about convenience for me.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93The thing that Talkspace allows me to do is to put my hands in a lot of different pots,\'94 said Dr. Chapple, who communicates with 30 clients via Talkspace, treats 15 in person, and works as a full-time professor at the University of Central Florida. She also has a contract with Talkspace to advise other therapists.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The approximately 3,000 therapists who work on the platform are paid by \'93engagement,\'94 according to the company, based on the number of words they write to users or how often they talk by video or audio, with bonuses for client retention.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 According to multiple therapists, Talkspace paid special attention to their interactions with clients who worked at places like Google, Kroger and JetBlue \'97 \'93enterprise partners\'94 that provide Talkspace to employees as a perk. (The New York Times offers Talkspace to its workers as a benefit.)
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 A college professor who provided therapy via Talkspace for two years said the company reached out to her when it thought two clients from Google had been waiting too long for a response.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93Like all businesses, we focus on clients based on size and scope,\'94 said Dr. Leibowitz, the chief medical officer.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Last year, Talkspace introduced a new feature: a 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 button
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  that users could press after sending a message that required the therapist to respond within a certain time frame. If the therapists don\'92t respond in time, their pay can be docked.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Some therapists on the platform were alarmed, in part because the function required them to work on demand, rather than on their own schedule. More significantly, they asked: Is it harmful to give clients with anxiety and boundary issues a button to press for immediate gratification?
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93That\'92s a corporate model: You need to respond to the customer no matter what,\'94 said Shara Sand, a psychologist with her own practice in New York. \'93Limit-setting and boundary-setting is part of the therapy. If you can\'92t manage not to talk to your therapist for four hours, you are very ill and need a higher level of care than a texting app.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Pushback on clinical benefits
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Talkspace is advertised to users as unlimited, \'9324/7\'94 messaging therapy. \'93Your therapist will see your messages and respond to you throughout the day,\'94 the company 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 says
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone . Therapists 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 get a different pitch
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone : \'93Set your business hours, and check in on your clients daily, five days per week.\'94
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The company says the two messages are not in conflict. \'93I don\'92t think it\'92s a discrepancy in expectations,\'94 said Rachel O\'92Neill, a licensed therapist at Talkspace whose title is director of clinical effectiveness. \'93It\'92s not 24/7 therapy, it\'92s 24/7 ability to communicate.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Some traditional mental health professionals question the free-flowing format, saying that the benefits of therapy stem from regular, scheduled check-ins \'97 sessions with clear beginnings and endings that help mark progress.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93It\'92s called the \'91frame\'92 in psychoanalysis. It\'92s the room. It\'92s how long the session will last. How much it will cost,\'94 said Berkeley\'92s Ms. Zeavin. \'93Boundaries are really important to the history of therapy. If texting is equated with no boundaries, that\'92s a real problem.\'94
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 There has been 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 limited study
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  into how effective teletherapy is. Much of it either has been conducted by 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Talkspace itself
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  or has involved therapy via 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 video sessions
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , not just text.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 \'93Talkspace\'92s No. 1 priority is quality of care for patients and driving the clinical outcomes desired by patients,\'94 Dr. Leibowitz said. \'93Talkspace has conducted research in partnership with many of the top academic universities,\'94 he said, adding that the work has yielded \'9310 vetted papers in peer-reviewed journals.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Lynn Bufka, the senior director for practice transformation and quality at the American Psychological Association, or A.P.A., said the research on text-based therapy has been based on surveys of whether people find it satisfactory.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93There\'92s been much less research into whether there\'92s a clinical benefit,\'94 Dr. Bufka said. \'93We would offer cautions around relying on text therapy, particularly when there is greater severity in terms of symptoms. We would urge people to seek direct care, which at this time would be by phone or video.\'94
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 In 2018, a therapists advocacy group called the Psychotherapy Action Network wrote a letter to the A.P.A. and to the Olympian Michael Phelps, who has appeared in ads for Talkspace, calling the company a \'93problematic treatment provider who aggressively sells an untested, risky treatment.\'94 After receiving the letter, the A.P.A. changed its 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 policy
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  on therapy-tech ads and stopped letting Talkspace exhibit at conferences.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In 2019, after Talkspace signed a deal with Optum, a unit of the health care giant UnitedHealth, to provide teletherapy to its two million customers, the advocacy group wrote another 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 letter of \'93alarm\'94
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  to the A.P.A. Talkspace 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 sued the group for defamation
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , claiming damages of $40 million. The lawsuit was dismissed for jurisdictional reasons.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 \'93Maybe their products and services are helpful to certain people,\'94 said Linda Michaels, a founder of the Psychotherapy Action Network. \'93But it\'92s just not therapy.\'94
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Until 2018, the 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Talkspace user agreement
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  said the same thing: \'93This Site Does Not Provide Therapy. It provides Therapeutic conversation with a licensed therapist.\'94 The company has since removed the clause.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 \'93That is very old,\'94 Dr. Leibowitz said. \'93The company has evolved quite a bit.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Mr. Lori no longer uses the Talkspace app. But he is still seeing the therapist, Ms. Brennan, whom he originally met via the platform.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93Even through this toxic company, wonderful things can happen,\'94 he said. \'93It\'92s such a sad story in totality, of what the company could have been versus what it is.\'94

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Meredith Kimberly Weber and Alexander Karlen Blitstein were married Oct. 6 at the Cyclorama at the Boston Center for the Arts in Boston. Rabbi Mark R. Newton officiated.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The bride, 32, is the deputy director of the Climate Science Legal Defense Fund, a New York-based nonprofit organization that provides legal defense and education to the climate science community. She graduated summa cum laude from the University of Pennsylvania and received a master's degree in arts administration from Columbia. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   She is the daughter of Dr. Dorothy Altman Weber and Stephen R. Weber of Boston.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The groom, also 32, is a data scientist in New York, where he recently completed the Metis 
\f0\i\b \ul Data Science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Bootcamp, an immersive program in which students work independently on applied 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  projects. He graduated from Binghamton University.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   He is a son of Barbara Karlen Blitstein of White Plains and Mark R. Blitstein of Coconut Creek, Fla.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The couple began dating in October 2015, after meeting through mutual friends in New York several years earlier.

\cf0 In 2003, Craig Nevill-Manning, a computer scientist at Google, wanted to set up an engineering outpost in New York. Google\'92s top leaders were skeptical, but they told him that he could go ahead if he could find 15 \'93Google-worthy\'94 software developers in the city.\
\'93The attitude was that pretty much all the good software engineers were in Silicon Valley,\'94 Mr. Nevill-Manning recalled. \'93It seems crazy in retrospect.\'94\
Mr. Nevill-Manning found his developers and opened the engineering office in New York. Today, Google employs 7,000 people in the city, and more than half are engineers and technical staff.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 The Google story mirrors the rise and evolution of New York as a genuine tech hub \'97 home to a deep pool of technical talent as well as sales, marketing and business expertise. And 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Amazon\'92s decision to put a headquarters
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone in the city, eventually employing more than 25,000 workers, only reinforces that trend.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 [Do you live or work near Amazon\'92s proposed new headquarters in Queens, N.Y., or Arlington, Va.? We want to hear from you.]\
\'93This solidifies New York\'92s importance and significance in tech,\'94 said Fred Wilson, the dean of New York\'92s venture capital community and co-founder of Union Square Ventures.\
Amazon, like most big tech companies, is no stranger to New York. It already has over 2,000 workers in New York, from e-commerce marketers to cloud computing engineers.\
Facebook has over 2,000 New York employees, including Yann LeCun, its chief artificial intelligence scientist and a pioneer in the field. Salesforce employs more than 1,000 at its new offices in New York. And tech stalwart IBM chose the city as the headquarters for its Watson artificial intelligence and cloud computing divisions.\
Most technology work in New York has traditionally been in service of other industries. That market, too, is growing briskly as banks, retailers, advertising and consulting firms \'97 major employers in New York \'97 are all getting digital makeovers and hiring. Goldman Sachs, for example, employs 2,000 tech workers in New York, including data analysts, app developers, digital security and blockchain experts. Manuela Veloso, head of the machine-learning department at Carnegie Mellon University, joined JPMorgan Chase this year to lead its A.I. research team.\
The five companies with the most tech-related job listings in New York over the last three months on Indeed.com, the jobs listing site, are Amazon, BNY Mellon, Capgemini, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.\
Measurements of tech sector jobs vary, depending on definitions. But the broad picture is a growing labor market for well-paying jobs. From 2010 to 2017, according to government statistics, tech sector employment grew by 53,000 in the city, or 65 percent, to an estimated 134,700. And the average salary of $147,300 in 2016, the most recent estimate available, was far higher than the citywide average of $89,100 for all private employers.\
The Bay Area, to be sure, remains the nation\'92s high-tech epicenter. New York is growing impressively, but its tech work force, according to most analyses, is less than half and perhaps one-third that of the Bay Area.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 New York fairly consistently ranks second behind the Bay Area in attracting venture capital. In the third quarter, for example, investors put $5.9 billion in start-ups in the New York metropolitan area, according to figures compiled by the 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 PwC-CB Insights MoneyTree Report
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone .\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 But the Bay Area, including San Francisco and Silicon Valley, took in $12.8 billion. Start-ups in the Washington, D.C. region, where Amazon plans to put another large headquarters, received $575 million in the third quarter.\
In the past, New York start-ups typically sold out to larger tech companies. That, too, is changing. Mr. Wilson, the venture capitalist, pointed to MongoDB, a database supplier, and Etsy, an e-commerce seller, as examples of start-ups that held out and went public in recent years.\
MongoDB trades at about $70 a share, compared with its initial price of $24 a share, when it went public in October 2017. Etsy, which went public at $16 a share in 2015, currently trades at about $47 a share.\
\'93New York entrepreneurs, investors and boards are just starting to get the courage to stay independent and grow here,\'94 Mr. Wilson said.\
The rise of New York\'92s tech sector, businesspeople and technologists agree, owes a debt to former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. He pushed initiatives to make the New York economy less dependent on finance and championed tech programs and education \'97 a long-term campaign to upgrade the technical skills of the city\'92s work force, whose progress enhanced New York\'92s appeal to Amazon.\
After the financial crisis hit in 2008, Mr. Bloomberg stepped up those efforts. In 2010, his administration announced an applied sciences competition.\
The city solicited proposals from universities and research organizations for a new center of higher education that would focus on technology, innovation and business. The winner, announced in December 2011, was a joint plan by Cornell University and the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology.\
The new institution, Cornell Tech, got underway in Manhattan in 2012, and last year moved into three buildings in its first phase of development on Roosevelt Island. There are now 300 graduate students on campus. Over the next two decades, the plan calls for two million square feet of buildings, a student population of 2,000 and hundreds of faculty. Daniel Huttenlocher, the dean of Cornell Tech, sits on Amazon\'92s board.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 The prospect of new competition served as a prod \'97 and encouragement \'97 to both Columbia University and New York University. Columbia expanded its engineering and computer science programs, and created the 
\f0\i\b \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Data Science
\f4\b0  Institute
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone . N.Y.U. absorbed an engineering school, Polytechnic University, which in 2015 became N.Y.U.\'92s Tandon School of Engineering.\
N.Y.U. also took over an old, unused Metropolitan Transportation Authority building in Brooklyn, renovated it and has begun populating it with tech-fueled research ventures, starting with the 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Center for Urban Science and Progress
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone .\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 For technologists who have recently come to New York, part of its appeal is the same thing that explains why its tech sector is often overlooked: New York\'92s huge and diverse economy, and its culture.\
\'93Everything is tech-driven on the West Coast,\'94 said Jeannette Wing, who left Microsoft Research last year to become the director of Columbia\'92s 
\f0\i\b \ul Data Science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Institute. \'93But the East Coast is more well rounded. It is about technology, but not just technology for its own sake.\'94\

\f2\fs20 \cf0 In 2016, Ricardo Lori was an avid user of Talkspace -- an app that lets people text and chat with a licensed therapist throughout the day. A part-time actor in New York City, Mr. Lori struggled with depression and anxiety, and he credited the app with helping him get out of an abusive relationship. He was a believer in Talkspace's stated mission to make ''therapy available and affordable for all,'' and when the start-up offered him a job in its customer support department, Mr. Lori was ecstatic.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Talkspace, which has raised more than $100 million from investors, had an office in the old Studio 54 building in Midtown Manhattan, with all the usual perks -- a Ping-Pong table in the conference room and beer and wine in the company fridge, plus all the therapy employees wanted. ''I felt like I was at the best place in the world,'' Mr. Lori said. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   After he wrote a general account of his therapy sessions on the company blog, an executive named Linda Sacco came to Mr. Lori with an intimate request. She wanted to give employees a sense of a typical user's experience. Could she and one of the company's co-founders, Roni Frank, read through two weeks of his therapy chat logs and then share excerpts with the staff?
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mr. Lori thought about his sessions, which included deeply personal information about his sex life and insecurities. Ms. Sacco assured Mr. Lori that they would keep him anonymous. ''If I wasn't such a true believer, I probably would have said, 'Are you nuts?' But I was so enamored of the place,'' said Mr. Lori. He agreed.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   At an all-hands meeting on a Friday afternoon in December 2016, employees gathered in a 13th-floor conference room. The Ping-Pong table was folded up so that Ms. Sacco and Ms. Frank could sit on the floor, cross-legged and back-to-back, for a dramatic reading. Ms. Sacco played the role of the therapist; Ms. Frank played a female version of Mr. Lori.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   As Mr. Lori drank a tall glass of red wine and watched, he noticed that a few employees kept glancing his way. Afterward, a member of the marketing department approached and asked if he was OK. Later, Oren Frank, Ms. Frank's husband and the chief executive, thanked him in the elevator. Somehow, word had gotten around that Mr. Lori was the client in the re-enactment.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mr. Lori began to reconsider whether Talkspace was the dream employer he'd imagined -- and whether it could be trusted to protect the privacy of its users.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Everything was done with employee-informed consent,'' said Ms. Sacco, who no longer works at Talkspace. John Reilly, a lawyer for Talkspace, said, ''At the time, the employee expressed great pride over their Talkspace treatment with their therapist, and willingly told multiple co-workers that the transcript was theirs.'' Mr. Lori said he did so only after it became clear that his identity was widely known.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Despite the embarrassing episode, Mr. Lori stayed with the company for two more years, until he was let go in 2018. He sued Talkspace for discrimination and wrongful termination, claiming he was told that his anxiety and depression were interfering with his work. The lawsuit settled at the beginning of 2020. Mr. Lori asked the company to take down his blog post; the company didn't, which is part of why Mr. Lori decided to share his story with a reporter.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mr. Lori and other former Talkspace employees, who asked not to be named for fear of being sued, describe a company with an admirable ambition to destigmatize therapy -- but that they say has questionable marketing practices and regards treatment transcripts as another data resource to be mined. Their accounts suggest that the needs of a venture capital-backed start-up to grow quickly can sometimes be in conflict with the core values of professional therapy, including strict confidentiality and patient welfare.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   This year, with a pandemic, a recession and an election shredding Americans' nerves, those concerns are relevant to more people than ever before: In May, Talkspace told The Washington Post that its client base had jumped 65 percent since mid-February.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''The app-ification of mental health care has real problems,'' said Hannah Zeavin, a lecturer in the English department at the University of California, Berkeley whose book about teletherapy is scheduled to be published next year by MIT Press. ''These are corporate platforms first. And they offer therapy second.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Talkspace has democratized access to therapy and psychiatry by meeting patients where they are in their lives and making treatment more affordable,'' said Neil Leibowitz, Talkspace's chief medical officer. ''The need is profound, especially now in this time of unease, and we are so proud of what our team of therapists is achieving.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Burner phones
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Signing up with Talkspace is quick. Users create an account, fill out a questionnaire, and get a choice of therapists, who work for the platform as independent contractors. Those who sign up for the ''Unlimited Messaging Therapy Plus'' plan, at $260 a month, can send a therapist messages at any time and are promised daily responses. Higher-priced subscription tiers offer ''live sessions'' of 30 minutes. While users can send messages by text, audio and video, Talkspace is known popularly as a platform for texting.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The company was founded in 2011 by Oren and Roni Frank, an Israeli couple who felt inspired after their relationship was ''saved'' by marriage counseling. Mr. Frank had a background in marketing, and Ms. Frank was a software developer.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Ms. Frank is the company's head of clinical services; as of Aug. 6, her LinkedIn page said she had a master's degree in psychoanalysis and psychotherapy from the New York Graduate School of Psychoanalysis, but she never completed the program. The degree claim was deleted after an inquiry from The Times. Mr. Reilly said Ms. Frank ''studied for an M.A. but left her program before completion to launch Talkspace. Her LinkedIn profile was created while she was studying, the inadvertent error was corrected as soon as the NYT brought this to our attention.'' 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The app launched in 2014 to positive press but lukewarm customer reviews, with ratings of about three stars out of five on both the Google and Apple app stores, according to a Times analysis. Users complained about glitchy software and unresponsive therapists.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   In 2015 and 2016, according to four former employees, the company sought to improve its ratings: It asked workers to write positive reviews. One employee said that Talkspace's head of marketing at the time asked him to compile 100 fake reviews in a Google spreadsheet, so that employees could submit them to app stores. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mr. Lori said that Talkspace gave employees ''burner'' phones to help evade the app stores' techniques for detecting false reviews. ''They said, 'Don't do it here. Do it at home. Give us five-star ratings because we have too many bad reviews,''' Mr. Lori said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mr. Reilly, the Talkspace lawyer, disputed this account, saying that employees were free to write reviews any way they liked. ''We alerted employees if they were to leave a review, to do it from their personal phones -- not from the Talkspace office network, as that would cause issues with the app store,'' Mr. Reilly said in an emailed statement. ''To be clear: We have never used fake identities or encouraged anybody to do so; there is no event involving 'burner' phones, and the idea in and of itself is nonsensical relative to the large number of reviews outstanding.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mr. Lori still has the iPhone 4 that Talkspace gave him. On the back, there is a white sticker on which someone has written ''#7 App Store login,'' along with a Yahoo email address and password. Two other former employees said burner phones were made available to workers.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Fake reviews are deceptive to consumers,'' said Eric Goldman, co-director of the High Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University. If the Talkspace employees didn't disclose their role when leaving reviews, ''then the company-encouraged reviews are problematic on multiple legal fronts,'' Mr. Goldman said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Posting fake online reviews is considered a deceptive business practice and can violate laws against false advertising. The New York attorney general and the Federal Trade Commission have fined companies for posting such reviews, though consequences can also be less severe. After the F.T.C. accused the cosmetics brand Sunday Riley of posting fake reviews, it simply made the company agree not to do so again.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Google and Apple forbid developers from soliciting fraudulent reviews. Apple says violators may have their apps removed from the App Store.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Irreverence unusual to health care
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Talkspace has also seized on moments of national anxiety as opportunities for promotion. On Nov. 9, 2016, the morning after the election of Donald Trump, Mr. Frank wrote on Twitter: ''Long night in NYC. Woke up this morning to record sales.'' The company told reporters that users were flocking to the app to help process the news. CNBC and The Washington Post published stories about Talkspace's ''7-fold spike in traffic,'' and Mr. Frank shared a Fast Company link claiming a ''7x spike in sales.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   According to data from two app analytics firms, App Annie and Sensor Tower, the number of Talkspace downloads declined in the months after the election. The Times analyzed more than 3,600 reviews of the Talkspace app. There was no significant increase in the number of reviews, positive or negative, following the 2016 election.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Dr. Leibowitz, Talkspace's chief medical officer, who joined the company in 2018, said in an email: ''We saw an uptick in use after the election, including, as the piece mentions, an uptick in traffic from existing clients concerned about election results. App analytics fail to capture a few elements: Much of our traffic is on the web.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The Trump election tweets are examples of the sometimes unfiltered social media presence of Mr. Frank and Talkspace -- an irreverence familiar among start-ups but unusual among organizations devoted to mental health care.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   In 2016, a man named Ross complained on Twitter that the company's subway ads ''were designed to trigger you into needing their services.'' Talkspace's official Twitter account responded, ''Ads for food make people hungry, right?'' and added, ''I get what you're saying, Ross, but medical professionals need people to buy things.'' The company later deleted the messages and blocked the man. (Ross wrote about the exchange in a Medium post; when The Times asked for comment recently, he deleted it and asked that his full name be withheld, citing personal reasons.)
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   From his own Twitter account, Mr. Frank called the man a ''sweet bored troll'' and mocked him for spending $20,000 a year on therapy, saying Talkspace could offer ''a more affordable alternative.'' The company declined to comment about the episode.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   'We need data. All of our data.'
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Therapy sessions are incredibly sensitive by their nature -- they are intended to be a sacrosanct space for people to confess their secrets and share their deepest vulnerabilities.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Talkspace's website promises users that their conversations will be ''safe and confidential,'' but people may not have as much control as they might think over what happens to their data. Users can't delete their transcripts, for example, because they are considered medical records. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Talkspace's privacy policy states that ''non-identifying and aggregate information'' may be used ''to better design our website'' and ''in research and trend analysis.'' The impression left is a detached and impersonal process. But former employees and therapists told The Times that individual users' anonymized conversations were routinely reviewed and mined for insights.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Karissa Brennan, a New York-based therapist, provided services via Talkspace from 2015 to 2017, including to Mr. Lori. She said that after she provided a client with links to therapy resources outside of Talkspace, a company representative contacted her, saying she should seek to keep her clients inside the app.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''I was like, 'How do you know I did that?''' Ms. Brennan said. ''They said it was private, but it wasn't.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The company says this would only happen if an algorithmic review flagged the interaction for some reason -- for example, if the therapist recommended medical marijuana to a client. Ms. Brennan says that to the best of her recollection, she had sent a link to an anxiety worksheet.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Talkspace also has been analyzing transcripts in order to develop bots that monitor and augment therapists' work. During a presentation in 2019, a Talkspace engineer specializing in machine learning said the research was important because certain cues that a client is in distress that could be caught during in-person sessions might be missed when a therapist is only communicating by text. Software might better catch those cues.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Last year, Mr. Frank wrote an opinion article for The Times encouraging people to make their health data available to researchers. ''We need data. All of our data. Mine and yours,'' he wrote, arguing that analysis of anonymous data sets could improve treatment.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The anonymous data Talkspace collects is not used just for medical advancements; it's used to better sell Talkspace's product. Two former employees said the company's data scientists shared common phrases from clients' transcripts with the marketing team so that it could better target potential customers.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The company disputes this. ''We are a data-focused company, and 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  and clinical leadership will from time to time share insights with their colleagues,'' Mr. Reilly said. ''This can include evaluating critical information that can help us improve best practices.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   He added: ''It never has and never will be used for marketing purposes.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   'Engagement'-based therapy
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Many licensed therapists sign up with Talkspace for reasons similar to why drivers work for Uber. The company provides a steady stream of clients, takes care of administrative tasks and deals with some insurance issues.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''The beauty of text-based therapy is we are meeting clients where they are, and giving them access to something different,'' said Reshawna Chapple, a Talkspace therapist whom the company made available for an interview. ''It's about convenience for me.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''The thing that Talkspace allows me to do is to put my hands in a lot of different pots,'' said Dr. Chapple, who communicates with 30 clients via Talkspace, treats 15 in person, and works as a full-time professor at the University of Central Florida. She also has a contract with Talkspace to advise other therapists.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The approximately 3,000 therapists who work on the platform are paid by ''engagement,'' according to the company, based on the number of words they write to users or how often they talk by video or audio, with bonuses for client retention.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   According to multiple therapists, Talkspace paid special attention to their interactions with clients who worked at places like Google, Kroger and JetBlue -- ''enterprise partners'' that provide Talkspace to employees as a perk. (The New York Times offers Talkspace to its workers as a benefit.)
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   A college professor who provided therapy via Talkspace for two years said the company reached out to her when it thought two clients from Google had been waiting too long for a response.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Like all businesses, we focus on clients based on size and scope,'' said Dr. Leibowitz, the chief medical officer.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Last year, Talkspace introduced a new feature: a button that users could press after sending a message that required the therapist to respond within a certain time frame. If the therapists don't respond in time, their pay can be docked.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Some therapists on the platform were alarmed, in part because the function required them to work on demand, rather than on their own schedule. More significantly, they asked: Is it harmful to give clients with anxiety and boundary issues a button to press for immediate gratification?
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''That's a corporate model: You need to respond to the customer no matter what,'' said Shara Sand, a psychologist with her own practice in New York. ''Limit-setting and boundary-setting is part of the therapy. If you can't manage not to talk to your therapist for four hours, you are very ill and need a higher level of care than a texting app.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Pushback on clinical benefits
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Talkspace is advertised to users as unlimited, ''24/7'' messaging therapy. ''Your therapist will see your messages and respond to you throughout the day,'' the company says. Therapists get a different pitch: ''Set your business hours, and check in on your clients daily, five days per week.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The company says the two messages are not in conflict. ''I don't think it's a discrepancy in expectations,'' said Rachel O'Neill, a licensed therapist at Talkspace whose title is director of clinical effectiveness. ''It's not 24/7 therapy, it's 24/7 ability to communicate.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Some traditional mental health professionals question the free-flowing format, saying that the benefits of therapy stem from regular, scheduled check-ins -- sessions with clear beginnings and endings that help mark progress.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''It's called the 'frame' in psychoanalysis. It's the room. It's how long the session will last. How much it will cost,'' said Berkeley's Ms. Zeavin. ''Boundaries are really important to the history of therapy. If texting is equated with no boundaries, that's a real problem.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   There has been limited study into how effective teletherapy is. Much of it either has been conducted by Talkspace itself or has involved therapy via video sessions, not just text.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Talkspace's No. 1 priority is quality of care for patients and driving the clinical outcomes desired by patients,'' Dr. Leibowitz said. ''Talkspace has conducted research in partnership with many of the top academic universities,'' he said, adding that the work has yielded ''10 vetted papers in peer-reviewed journals.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Lynn Bufka, the senior director for practice transformation and quality at the American Psychological Association, or A.P.A., said the research on text-based therapy has been based on surveys of whether people find it satisfactory.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''There's been much less research into whether there's a clinical benefit,'' Dr. Bufka said. ''We would offer cautions around relying on text therapy, particularly when there is greater severity in terms of symptoms. We would urge people to seek direct care, which at this time would be by phone or video.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   In 2018, a therapists advocacy group called the Psychotherapy Action Network wrote a letter to the A.P.A. and to the Olympian Michael Phelps, who has appeared in ads for Talkspace, calling the company a ''problematic treatment provider who aggressively sells an untested, risky treatment.'' After receiving the letter, the A.P.A. changed its policy on therapy-tech ads and stopped letting Talkspace exhibit at conferences.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   In 2019, after Talkspace signed a deal with Optum, a unit of the health care giant UnitedHealth, to provide teletherapy to its two million customers, the advocacy group wrote another letter of ''alarm'' to the A.P.A. Talkspace sued the group for defamation, claiming damages of $40 million. The lawsuit was dismissed for jurisdictional reasons.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Maybe their products and services are helpful to certain people,'' said Linda Michaels, a founder of the Psychotherapy Action Network. ''But it's just not therapy.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Until 2018, the Talkspace user agreement said the same thing: ''This Site Does Not Provide Therapy. It provides Therapeutic conversation with a licensed therapist.'' The company has since removed the clause.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''That is very old,'' Dr. Leibowitz said. ''The company has evolved quite a bit.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mr. Lori no longer uses the Talkspace app. But he is still seeing the therapist, Ms. Brennan, whom he originally met via the platform.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Even through this toxic company, wonderful things can happen,'' he said. ''It's such a sad story in totality, of what the company could have been versus what it is.''

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Reeba Monachan and Keshav Attrey
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The couple first made contact in December 2016 in Washington, where Ms. Monachan was working for the Department of Education, and Mr. Attrey, then living and working on the West Coast, was visiting the mother of a close friend who was hospitalized there.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 On a Friday, Mr. Attrey went on the dating website OKCupid and connected with Ms. Monachan. \'93She was a very beautiful Indian girl,\'94 he said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Ms. Monachan was also impressed. \'93I thought, wow, he\'92s really attractive,\'94 she said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 She loved his line about travel. \'93Many people travel to see the sights,\'94 he wrote. \'93For me, the adventure lies in the people I meet, the stories they share, and the completely unexpected adventures that happen while I\'92m there.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 They arranged for a Sunday get-together over coffee at a bake shop in Arlington, Va., where Mr. Attrey found Ms. Monachan photographing the macaroons for Snapchat.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In between sips of coffee they learned that while they were both of Indian descent, his parents were from New Delhi and Himachal, in north India, and were Sikh and Hindu, while her family was from Kerala, in south India, and were Christian.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 They also discovered that they had both grown up in Charlotte, about 30 minutes apart, and had many mutual friends.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 They realized they were at the same Festival of India celebration in Charlotte in 2007. Mr. Attrey was on stage playing a tabla (an Indian percussion instrument), while Ms. Attrey was in the crowd cheering on the dancers, one of whom was a cousin.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93We found out that we ran in many of the same social circles,\'94 Ms. Monachan said, \'93Even though Keshav is a bit older than me, it\'92s incredible that we never met.\'94

\f2\fs20 \cf0 BD Wong, Richert Schnorr
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 BD Wong and Richert John Frederickson Schnorr are to be married Oct. 7 at Giando on the Water in Brooklyn. Cantor Sheera Ben-David is to officiate.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \cf0 SAN FRANCISCO -- Twitter created a team to automatically seek out suspicious activity, like thousands of messages intended to suppress the vote. It began coordinating closely with the Department of Homeland Security. And it recently introduced a tool to help people more easily report misleading tweets.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Ahead of the midterm elections on Tuesday, ''we are more prepared than we have ever been,'' said Del Harvey, Twitter's head of trust and safety. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Yet over the last few months, Twitter has also grappled with a profusion of accounts masquerading as state Republican officials, and accounts pushing memes that falsely claimed immigration officials would be patrolling polling stations. Last week, researchers at Oxford University said Twitter now had 5 percent more false content than it did during the 2016 American presidential election.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Never has it actually reached this threshold that we've seen now,'' said Lisa-Maria Neudert, one the Oxford researchers.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   With Americans going to the polls on Tuesday, it is down to the wire for social media companies to show that they have clamped down on disinformation and foreign interference through their sites. The companies want to prove that the midterm elections will not be a repeat of 2016, when Russian operatives used Facebook, Twitter and YouTube to spread divisive messages in an attempt to influence how the American electorate voted.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Facebook, which has borne the brunt of scrutiny over election interference, has introduced measures to limit who can buy political ads, has hired more people to monitor what gets posted, and has constructed a ''war room'' to root out false information and stop it from spreading. Last week, Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, told investors that the company was getting ''better and better'' at detecting election interference but that ''there are going to be things that our systems miss no matter how well tuned we are.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   A close look at Twitter also suggests that disinformation and election interference are far from under control. Even as the company has taken steps to reduce problems, new instances of misinformation campaigns continue to surface.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Our work on this issue is not done, nor will it ever be,'' Jack Dorsey, Twitter's chief executive, told Congress in September. He said that the company had learned valuable lessons since the 2016 election and that it was now removing 214 percent more accounts a year for violating its policies against manipulation.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   [Here's a guide to everything you need to know about the November elections.]
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Twitter began looking more closely at election interference after the 2016 presidential vote. Late that year, it assembled a 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  team to use technology to detect malicious and misleading behavior on its service. In particular, the team tries to identify oddities, like a cluster of accounts that were registered with the same email address or phone number, or accounts that were engaging in spammy behavior like tweeting constantly at high-profile accounts to amplify their posts.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   In the fall of 2017, the 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  team led a study of 2016 election interference campaigns on Twitter. The findings, released in November 2017, included 50,000 Russia-linked accounts that were automated and tweeting election-related content. Twitter said it used the discoveries to home in on how to prepare for the midterms, like improving its ability to find a high volume of automated tweets.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Unless we really build out our enforcement capacity and have teams that are focused on identifying and patterning these behavior models, we're not going to be successful,'' Ms. Harvey said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Twitter said it also began asking for more help. In 2016, the company was not in regular contact with the Homeland Security Department or other government agencies, Ms. Harvey said. Over the summer, it began coordinating more with Homeland Security and is now also in regular contact with the F.B.I. and secretaries of state for various states, as well as Democratic and Republican campaign committees and nonprofits that track misinformation, Ms. Harvey said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The F.B.I. and Homeland Security Department did not respond to requests for comment.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Despite these steps, Twitter's issues have not subsided. In August, it found 50 accounts that were posing as state Republican officials, which it pulled down. In September and October, Twitter removed over 10,000 accounts masquerading as Democrats that were posting messages to discourage voting. One of the memes tweeted by the accounts falsely claimed that the Democratic National Committee was urging men not to vote in order to give women more sway over the midterms.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Over the past week, another series of memes on Twitter falsely said that Immigrations and Customs Enforcement would be patrolling voting stations on Tuesday. The company removed the posts.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Last week, the Oxford researchers released their study that concluded political news from conservative news outlets and right-wing sites like Breitbart, Gateway Pundit and The Daily Caller were circulating on Twitter more than articles from traditional sources. The researchers said they classified stories from those outlets as ''junk news.'' In addition, the researchers said, an increasing number of liberal groups were also spreading false news.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Twitter does not categorize some of the outlets mentioned in the study as ''junk news'' because it said those publications ''reflect views within American society.'' The company also said the researchers' methodology might have involved looking at a wide pool of tweets that would not have shown up to regular users. As a result, the research could contain ''a staggering margin of error,'' Yoel Roth, Twitter's head of site integrity, tweeted last week.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   This weekend, Guardians A.I., which is a consortium of technologists and academics focused on protecting pro-democracy groups from misinformation and cyberattacks, said it found a troubling spike in tweets that amplified false messages about voter fraud.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The researchers, who had been tracking 200 accounts that promoted the hashtag #VoterFraud, said those accounts posted a surge of tweets calling for violence and civil war that garnered more than 112 million impressions from Friday through Sunday, compared with about 37 million impressions in the previous seven days. There may be more such misinformation campaigns, the researchers added.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''We've seen a proliferation of a lot of voter fraud conspiracies that all spun up in the last 24 hours,'' said Brett Horvath, a co-founder of Guardians A.I.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   A Twitter spokesman said that because researchers pull data en masse from the service, they sometimes collect tweets that are caught by the company's automated filters -- meaning that some examples of misleading content are never viewed by regular users.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   On election night, Twitter intends to follow a template it developed during recent international elections: It plans to monitor its service for automated activity and will rely on partners like the Homeland Security Department as well as users to report misleading content. The company also said it planned to have hundreds of employees around the world working to make sure nothing goes wrong.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''We'll be in various places looking at our computers, mostly,'' Ms. Harvey said. ''The team is always on and working on this.''

\f2\fs20 \cf0 One day this fall, Ashutosh Garg, the chief executive of a recruiting service called Eightfold.ai, turned up a r\'e9sum\'e9 that piqued his interest.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It belonged to a prospective data scientist, someone who unearths patterns in data to help businesses make decisions, like how to target ads. But curiously, the r\'e9sum\'e9 featured the term ''
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone '' nowhere. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Instead, the r\'e9sum\'e9 belonged to an analyst at Barclays who had done graduate work in physics at the University of California, Los Angeles. Though his profile on the social network LinkedIn indicated that he had never worked as a data scientist, Eightfold's software flagged him as a good fit. He was similar in certain key ways, like his math and computer chops, to four actual data scientists whom Mr. Garg had instructed the software to consider as a model.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The idea is not to focus on job titles, but ''what skills they have,'' Mr. Garg said. ''You're really looking for people who have not done it, but can do it.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The power of such technology will be immediately apparent to any employer scrambling to fill jobs in a tight labor market -- not least positions for data scientists, whom companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon are competing to attract.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Thanks to services like Eightfold, which rely on sophisticated algorithms to match workers and jobs, many employers may soon have access to a universe of prospective workers -- even for hard-to-fill roles -- whom they might not otherwise have come across.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   And while that could also help some candidates, there's a potential downside for job seekers: Such algorithms may also lower wages in these fields, said Bo Cowgill, an economist at Columbia University who has studied the use of artificial intelligence in hiring.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''You get the more nontraditional, equally qualified, equally high-performing people,'' Mr. Cowgill said. But the employer ''doesn't seem to have to compete for them as much.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   For years, employers and online intermediaries have used algorithms to help fill job openings, but their methods were often crude. A computer would identify key words on r\'e9sum\'e9s, then determine whether those words corresponded to text in job descriptions.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   While this approach can be more efficient than manually searching a site like LinkedIn, it has drawbacks. Applicants can game the process by larding their r\'e9sum\'e9s with terms the machines are likely to be looking for. Conversely, poorly worded job listings could cause computers to overlook qualified candidates.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   But recent advances in a form of artificial intelligence known as deep learning have made the machines used by some companies, like Eightfold and the online job hub ZipRecruiter, far more powerful. Instead of simply scanning words on a page and matching them to words in a job description, a machine can now identify skills and aptitudes that don't explicitly appear on a candidate's r\'e9sum\'e9.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   To illustrate, Mr. Garg points out that about 90 percent of software engineers at the financial software company Intuit in Mountain View, Calif., know the programming language Java, according to data Eightfold has analyzed. That means the machine is on safe ground inferring that an Intuit software engineer knows Java, even if he or she doesn't list the skill on a r\'e9sum\'e9.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   By performing a similar exercise across an entire r\'e9sum\'e9, the company's software can build a detailed profile of a job applicant. It can extract more than the usual amount of information from categories like education (certain disciplines at less prominent universities, like natural-language processing at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, produce high-achieving workers) and even hobbies (chess players tend to be good at coding, basketball players at sales).
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Eightfold, which is based in Silicon Valley, also makes a clever trade with clients: to improve its results, Eightfold asks clients to use its human-resources software, which imports employee data in anonymous form. This includes information on how workers with different backgrounds perform in different jobs, and how much they earn.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Eightfold can then use this data to better predict performance -- say, how well an Intuit software engineer who plays chess and graduated from the University of Massachusetts might do at Amazon or Microsoft.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Intuit did not respond to a request for comment.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The software tool can be especially powerful to an employer intent on expanding a search beyond candidates with conventional experience and qualifications. In that case, a recruiter can specify criteria (like industry and location, and even how likely the candidate is to accept an offer) that would turn up less traditional r\'e9sum\'e9s.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Claudia Villanueva, a recruiting and diversity official at AdRoll Group, which helps clients with digital ads and marketing, said she recently used Eightfold when trying to fill a financial-planning position. The top candidate had experience in industries the tech world often shuns, like manufacturing. But the Eightfold algorithm flagged her as a winner.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''The tech industry sometimes has a hard time moving past tech experience,'' Ms. Villanueva said. ''We keep hiring the same people in the industry. To me this is a really interesting example of how we broke that cycle a bit.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   In the case of the Barclays analyst, Eightfold's software pegged him as a budding data scientist partly because he had a master's degree in statistics and knew computer programming languages like C++ and Matlab, even though he had no apparent background in 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone .
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''We have gone ahead and analyzed tens of millions to hundreds of millions of profiles of people to see how people have moved in their career,'' Mr. Garg said. ''You can predict what they're likely to do next very easily.'' He conceded that the approach worked less well in new or obscure fields with limited data.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Steve Goodman, the chief executive of Restless Bandit, another firm that applies artificial intelligence to recruiting, compared the exercise of finding nontraditional candidates to filling a professional sports roster.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Sports franchises tend to pay far more for free agents who leave their previous team than for players they draft out of college or high school, because the free agents have a record. But if computers were able to predict the performance of draft picks with relative precision, this could change their calculus. The price of free agents might drop, and the price of signing a draft pick would rise. This is, in effect, what software can accomplish using artificial intelligence.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''We surface people we think would be good draft picks,'' rather than people doing the same jobs, Mr. Goodman said. ''This person is a little more junior, but based on their career track, people who look like them are cheaper and better for you.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mr. Cowgill, the Columbia economist, said this logic was largely correct, but with one key wrinkle: According to his research, the gains to the less obviously qualified candidates unearthed by machines can be so large that they offset smaller losses to conventional candidates.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   In a technical field like software engineering, for example, a dropout from a no-name university could end up making a very comfortable living after becoming known to employers. But established coders are sufficiently in demand that wages are likely to remain high even as it becomes easier to find alternatives.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   In fields requiring fewer technical skills, on the other hand, wages could fall significantly.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Consider, say, senior marketing jobs, for which large companies often require a master's degree in business administration. If machines can reliably identify less experienced, less credentialed candidates who are likely to excel, it could depress wages.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''You can think of cases in the product market where people thought they needed something special and you really didn't -- the commodity, low-cost person took over,'' said John Horton, a labor economist at N.Y.U. Think of hand-held video cameras after the proliferation of smartphones.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''That could happen in labor markets with the realization that you don't need anything special here,'' Mr. Horton said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   All of this presumes, however, that deep-learning technology is viable for use in recruiting and human resources and could eventually become commonplace. Surveys suggest that only a small minority of companies have adopted these tools, and that even fewer feel prepared to exploit them.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   A recent paper summarizing the findings of a conference at the University of Pennsylvania, involving roughly 20 employers, cited a variety of problems. Among them were the difficulty of measuring employees' performance and the sense of unfairness that workers might feel if a computer were to make hiring, firing and promotion decisions.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Perhaps the greatest concern is a basic methodological point -- call it the N.B.A. problem. If you were studying National Basketball Association players to figure out what makes one great, you would find almost no correlation between performance and height. Almost everyone in this rarefied world is taller than average. And those who aren't compensate with other gifts, like unusual speed and athleticism.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   If, on the other hand, you selected people at random from the general population and gauged their basketball potential, you would find that it was highly correlated with height.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The concern is that machines are, in effect, only studying N.B.A. players -- the people who already have jobs at a company, or even the people who sought jobs -- not the general population.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mr. Cowgill believes there are solutions. He wrote a paper showing that seemingly unqualified applicants whom a company accidentally interviews allow a machine to simulate a crude randomized experiment, helping the company learn more about what makes a good employee.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   But perhaps more telling is that sophisticated technology companies are already using artificial intelligence to help fill jobs. Mr. Garg, who worked as a research scientist at Google for four years, says the company uses such techniques in its recruiting.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Google says it uses machines to take a second look at r\'e9sum\'e9s in its database that human recruiters may have missed for a limited set of roles.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The advantage that a vendor like Eightfold has, Mr. Garg asserted, is access to internal data at dozens of other companies, something even Google can't claim. ''We now can build much deeper models than these companies can build by themselves,'' he said.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Jeffrey Hammerbacher is a number cruncher -- a Harvard math major who went from a job as a Wall Street quant to a key role at Facebook to a founder of a successful data start-up.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 But five years ago, he was given a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, a crisis that fueled in him a fierce curiosity in medicine -- about how the body and brain work and why they sometimes fail. The more he read and talked to experts, the more he became convinced that medicine needed people like him: skilled practitioners of 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  who could guide scientific discovery and decision-making. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Now Mr. Hammerbacher, 32, is on the faculty of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, despite the fact that he has no academic training in medicine or biology. He is there because the school has begun an ambitious, well-funded initiative to apply 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  to medicine.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   A tall man with deep-set eyes and a close-cropped beard, Mr. Hammerbacher stood recently in front of a white board filled with an amalgam of computer and genetic code, speaking of ''Linux clusters'' and ''gnarly C code'' -- standard terms in the language of computing -- but the main subject was biomedical science. Mr. Hammerbacher also discussed ''neoantigens'' and ''gene variants,'' and the data-driven hunt to find and understand the rogue cell clusters of cancer.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''We're pursuing problems that are computationally and intellectually exciting, and where there is the potential to change how doctors treat patients in two or three years,'' Mr. Hammerbacher said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Eric Schadt, the computational biologist who recruited Mr. Hammerbacher to Mount Sinai, says the goal is to transform medicine into an information science, where data and computing are marshaled to deliver breakthroughs in the treatment of cancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes and other chronic diseases. Mount Sinai is only one of several major medical schools turning to 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  as a big part of the future of medicine and health care.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   They are reaching out to people like Mr. Hammerbacher, whose career arc traces the evolution of 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  as it has spread across the economy. After a job designing trading models at Bear Stearns, he worked for a few important years at Facebook, where he started the social network's data team and made his reputation and a tidy sum. Next, he was one of four founders of Cloudera, a fast-growing company that makes software tools for 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone . And now he is immersed in medicine.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Getting to this point has not been a predictable journey. He grew up in the Midwest. His father, Glenn, was an autoworker at a General Motors plant in Fort Wayne, Ind., and his mother, Lenore, was a nurse. He has had to overcome challenges, including mental illness. He has stepped beyond his background -- the data of his life -- more than most people.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Jeffrey Hammerbacher was always a numbers guy. That's evident in a school paper he wrote as a 7-year-old in Fort Wayne. ''My favorite hobby is doing math while I'm eating,'' he wrote in clear block letters. ''I like doing this because math is my favorite subject and I like to eat.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Math is still the subject he most admires. ''It's snobbery on my part, but I view math as the true arena in which human intellect is demonstrated at the highest level,'' he said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   He wasn't only a mathematician during his childhood. He began reading at age 4 and was soon one of the Fort Wayne library's best customers. He aced the test that allowed him to attend an excellent private school on a scholarship. Rachana Fischer, who is now a litigator in Silicon Valley, was a year ahead of him in high school. She recalls a recalcitrant student, but one who had read not only every math book in the school, but also the works of poets like Frank O'Hara and Vladimir Mayakovsky.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''His career is based on analyzing people by data and numbers,'' she said, ''but he doesn't fit into any box himself.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mr. Hammerbacher was a star pitcher in high school and, while his grades lagged, his athletic ability and his scores on standardized tests got him into Harvard. But by his sophomore year, he was struggling. He rarely attended classes, and he simply skipped final exams in his sophomore year.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Looking back, Mr. Hammerbacher called his behavior ''very wasteful'' and ''dumb'' and part of a disturbing pattern. ''I've had troubles with mood and anxiety at times in my life,'' he said. ''That's a challenge for me. It's been very humbling.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   He left Harvard and returned to his family's home in Fort Wayne, where he joined his father for a while at the G.M. factory. A year later, chastened by his experience, he went back to Harvard, and graduated in 2005.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   From that point on, Mr. Hammerbacher says, his career has been a matter of repeatedly following the smartest people in search of the best problems. Many of the sharpest math graduates from Harvard were going to Wall Street, and he did too.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   He landed at Bear Stearns in the summer of 2005 -- three years before it collapsed in the financial crisis. As a quantitative analyst, he built sophisticated computer models, mainly for mortgage securities. ''On a single mortgage hedge,'' he recalled, ''we made or lost more in a day than my father made in a lifetime.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   He stayed at Bear Stearns less than a year, enjoying the intellectual challenge of the work, but ultimately finding it unsatisfying. ''Our whole goal was to make the models more complex,'' he said. ''It was a really bad use of quantitative skills.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Better problems, Mr. Hammerbacher believed, were on the horizon. He wanted to work for one of the Internet companies that were becoming natural laboratories for 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone , and in 2006, he joined one of the most promising. It was a Silicon Valley start-up with fewer than 50 employees, including several people he knew from Harvard. He got a job at Facebook.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The social network was then a two-year-old company with sky's-the-limit ambitions. Mr. Hammerbacher was 23, two years older than Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder and chief executive.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Soon after arriving, Mr. Hammerbacher decided he wanted to use Facebook's data to improve its service. With a small team, he built software tools for gathering, analyzing and experimenting with data. Mostly, these were tests of what works best. For example, which page layout or feature change prompts users to spend more time on Facebook, or makes them more likely to send messages or post pictures.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   One group of online users is shown the change being tested, and another group is not. This so-called A/B testing is routine now in website development, online advertising and marketing. At Facebook, it would become more sophisticated in the years after Mr. Hammerbacher left. But he played an instrumental role in starting it. ''He laid the foundation for doing data analysis at scale,'' said Itamar Rosenn, manager of 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  infrastructure at Facebook.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Facebook was a great petri dish for 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone , but after three years, Mr. Hammerbacher tired of social networks and online advertising. He departed in late 2008, with shares worth millions, but with far less money than he would have made if he had stayed until Facebook went public in 2012. He has no regrets, he insists. Leaving Facebook, he said, freed him to ''work on things that matter more.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The first thing he did was become a co-founder of Cloudera, which was valued last year at $4.1 billion. He retains the title of chief scientist, although he now spends most of his time with Mount Sinai.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   While at Cloudera, Mr. Hammerbacher says, he took the punishing start-up lifestyle to self-destructive extremes.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Marathon workdays were capped by nights of partying, drinking and recreational drugs. His professional and personal life suffered. At work, Mr. Hammerbacher's appearance at meetings became less predictable.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   In March 2010, his old mood and anxiety problems erupted into a full-blown crisis. Mr. Hammerbacher was rushed to the emergency ward of a San Francisco hospital with a raging panic attack that felt like cardiac arrest or a stroke. A psychiatrist later diagnosed bipolar disorder and generalized anxiety. He quit recreational drugs and alcohol. He was treated with prescription drugs for several months, and also found that regular sleep, eating habits and exposure to sunlight helped.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Today, by all accounts, Mr. Hammerbacher is healthy and fit.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''He really committed himself to being sober,'' said Halle Tecco, his wife, who is executive managing director and co-founder of Rock Health, which funds and advises start-ups in health care, ''and to his family, his friends and his work.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mr. Hammerbacher responded to his personal health crisis with a characteristic outburst of curiosity, reading and seeking people to learn from. That propelled him toward medicine -- and to work with Dr. Schadt at Mount Sinai.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Dr. Schadt had concluded that medicine was ripe for a data-driven revolution. Chronic diseases, Dr. Schadt explained, are not caused by single genes, but are ''complex networked disorders'' involving genetics, but also patient characteristics such as weight, age, gender, vital signs, tobacco use, toxic exposure and exercise routines -- all of which can be captured as data and modeled.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''We are trying to move medicine in the direction of climatology and physics; disciplines that are far more advanced and mature quantitatively,'' he said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   That message resonated with Mr. Hammerbacher. By 2013 he was spending most of his time in New York rather than on the West Coast, assembling a research team that now numbers 10 people. Their expertise spans the breadth of 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone : machine learning, data visualization, statistics and programming.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   His group's objective is to alter how doctors treat patients someday. For example, Mount Sinai medical researchers have done promising work on personalized cancer treatments. It involves the genetic sequencing of a patient's healthy cells and cancer tumor. Once the misbehaving gene cluster is identified and analyzed, it is targeted with tailored therapies, drugs or vaccines that stimulate the body's defenses.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mr. Hammerbacher's team does not do the basic science. Other researchers do that. His group works on the ''computational pipeline,'' he said, with the goal of making personalized cancer treatments more automated and thus more affordable and practical. ''It's ultimately what cancer cures are going to look like,'' he said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The road to technology revolutions is paved with failure, halting progress and hard work. Mr. Hammerbacher and his colleagues are engaged in pathbreaking yet often frustrating 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  work.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   He is optimistic about his initiative's prospects, but has come to appreciate that the mysteries of the human body may be more resistant to math than finance or social networks are. Today he speaks less about quants taking over than about their lending a hand. ''We're not the most important people,'' he said, ''but we can help.''

\f2\fs20 \cf0 HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW calls 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  ''the sexiest job in the 21st century,'' and by most accounts this hot new field promises to revolutionize industries from business to government, health care to academia.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The field has been spawned by the enormous amounts of data that modern technologies create -- be it the online behavior of Facebook users, tissue samples of cancer patients, purchasing habits of grocery shoppers or crime statistics of cities. Data scientists are the magicians of the Big Data era. They crunch the data, use mathematical models to analyze it and create narratives or visualizations to explain it, then suggest how to use the information to make decisions.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In the last few years, dozens of programs under a variety of names have sprung up in response to the excitement about Big Data, not to mention the six-figure salaries for some recent graduates.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In the fall, Columbia will offer new master's and certificate programs heavy on data. The University of San Francisco will soon graduate its charter class of students with a master's in analytics. Other institutions teaching 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  include New York University, Stanford, Northwestern, George Mason, Syracuse, University of California at Irvine and Indiana University.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Rachel Schutt, a senior research scientist at Johnson Research Labs, taught ''Introduction to 
\f0\i\b \ul Data Science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone '' last semester at Columbia (its first course with ''
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone '' in the title). She described the data scientist this way: ''a hybrid computer scientist software engineer statistician.'' And added: ''The best tend to be really curious people, thinkers who ask good questions and are O.K. dealing with unstructured situations and trying to find structure in them.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Eurry Kim, a 30-year-old ''wannabe data scientist,'' is studying at Columbia for a master's in quantitative methods in the social sciences and plans to use her degree for government service. She discovered the possibilities while working as a corporate tax analyst at the Internal Revenue Service. She might, for example, analyze tax return data to develop algorithms that flag fraudulent filings, or cull national security databases to spot suspicious activity.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Some of her classmates are hoping to apply their skills to e-commerce, where data about users' browsing history is gold.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 ''This is a generation of kids that grew up with 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  around them -- Netflix telling them what movies they should watch, Amazon telling them what books they should read -- so this is an academic interest with real-world applications,'' said Chris Wiggins, a professor of applied mathematics at Columbia who is involved in its new Institute for Data Sciences and Engineering. ''And,'' he added, ''they know it will make them employable.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Universities can hardly turn out data scientists fast enough. To meet demand from employers, the United States will need to increase the number of graduates with skills handling large amounts of data by as much as 60 percent, according to a report by McKinsey Global Institute. There will be almost half a million jobs in five years, and a shortage of up to 190,000 qualified data scientists, plus a need for 1.5 million executives and support staff who have an understanding of data.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 North Carolina State University introduced a master's in analytics in 2007. All 84 of last year's graduates in the field had job offers, according to Michael Rappa, who conceived and directs the university's Institute for Advanced Analytics. The average salary was $89,100, and more than $100,000 for those with prior work experience.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 ''This has become relevant to every company,'' said Michael Chui, a principal at McKinsey who has studied the field. ''There's a war for this type of talent.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Because 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  is so new, universities are scrambling to define it and develop curriculums. As an academic field, it cuts across disciplines, with courses in statistics, analytics, computer science and math, coupled with the specialty a student wants to analyze, from patterns in marine life to historical texts.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 With the sheer volume, variety and speed of data today, as well as developing technologies, programs are more than a repackaging of existing courses. ''
\f0\i\b \ul Data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  is emerging as an academic discipline, defined not by a mere amalgamation of interdisciplinary fields but as a body of knowledge, a set of professional practices, a professional organization and a set of ethical responsibilities,'' said Christopher Starr, chairman of the computer science department at the College of Charleston, one of a few institutions offering 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  at the undergraduate level.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Most master's degree programs in 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  require basic programming skills. They start with what Ms. Schutt describes as the ''boring'' part -- scraping and cleaning raw data and ''getting it into a nice table where you can actually analyze it.'' Many use data sets provided by businesses or government, and pass back their results. Some host competitions to see which student can come up with the best solution to a company's problem.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 University of San Francisco students have used data from General Electric to predict how much energy windmills could create. At North Carolina State, with data from the Postal Service, students have analyzed response rates to junk mail to find ways to improve its effectiveness.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Studying a Web user's data has privacy implications. Using data to decide someone's eligibility for a line of credit or health insurance, or even recommending who they friend on Facebook, can affect their lives. ''We're building these models that have impact on human life,'' Ms. Schutt said. ''How can we do that carefully?'' Ethics classes address these questions.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Finally, students have to learn to communicate their findings, visually and orally, and they need business know-how, perhaps to develop new products.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 ''That's one of the challenges,'' said Terence Parr, program director of the analytics and computer science programs at the University of San Francisco. ''To be successful, you need to have a wide range of skills that doesn't fit in one department.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The question, said Bill Howe, who teaches 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  at the University of Washington, is whether it is even possible to instill in a single person all the skills needed, from statistics to predictive modeling to business strategy. The university's offerings range from a free online course on Coursera to a nine-month certificate program to a Ph.D. track in Big Data.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 ''It remains to be seen,'' he said, ''but we're still of the mind that a curriculum that aims to train data scientists is feasible.'' He added: ''What employers want is someone who can do it all.''

\f2\fs20 \cf0 If there hadn\'92t been two Dunkin\'92 stores on the same road in East Hartford, Conn., then maybe the Rev. Lydia Wittman and Rafi Ziauddin wouldn\'92t have ended up at different doughnut shops for their first date in 2014. And they wouldn\'92t have missed the beginning of the University of Connecticut football game or the tailgate party they meant to attend.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 But when they did manage to meet up (she left her Dunkin\'92 and drove to his once they straightened out the mix-up), they soon discovered that a cup of coffee and a nice chat trumped rushing to the stadium.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93That was a little more important than getting there for the kickoff,\'94 she said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Once they did get to the game, the two, who first connected on Match.com, discovered that they share a passion for other sports \'97 she loves to ski and he loves snowboarding \'97 and they made a pact to get to the mountains together that winter.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93That was hopeful to me,\'94 Ms. Wittman said. \'93It was clear to both of us that we were interested because we were making plans for a couple months later.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Mr. Ziauddin says that he gave her a peck on the cheek that night when they parted, but a few days later, when she drove up to his place, in Easthampton, Mass., they had a proper kiss over takeout food and amid the boxes strewn around the condo he had just moved into.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Ms. Wittman, 42, was at the time the pastor of a Lutheran church in Glastonbury, Conn. She is now the chaplain at St. Anthony Summit Medical Center in Frisco, Colo. She graduated from Concordia University in St. Paul, Minn., and received a Master of Divinity from the University of Chicago as well as a certificate of advanced theological studies from Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, Calif. A previous marriage ended in divorce.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Mr. Ziauddin, 41, was then an actuary for risk management at the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company in Springfield, Mass. He graduated from Tulane and received a master\'92s degree in quantitative and computational finance from the Georgia Institute of Technology. He has plans to apply to graduate school in applied statistics or 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone .
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Mr. Ziauddin, who is Muslim, said initially he was hesitant to pursue the relationship because of their religious differences, but with time he was able to let that go. \'93The differences just seemed of less and less concern the more I got to know her,\'94 he said. \'93We were compatible.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Ms. Wittman, who will take her husband\'92s name, said that she realized she was in love with him when he was coaching her in how to play tennis. \'93It was a few lessons in,\'94 she said. \'93I remember we were on the court, and I was having a hard time listening to the instructions because I was so interested in him.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In 2016, she decided to change career directions by beginning a residency as a chaplain in Aurora, Colo., and the couple moved West.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 They ended up in Frisco, a ski town near four resorts, including Breckenridge and Copper Mountain, and it was in that town that they intended to be married. They had planned for 110 guests, but decided after the arrival of coronavirus, that a wedding near where his parents live, and close enough for her parents to drive to, would be a better option.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 So on July 25, the couple were married in Chattanooga, Tenn., in a wedding that began with a Muslim ceremony led by Imam Sadek Alsouqi, at the Islamic Society of Greater Chattanooga, and concluded at Trinity Lutheran Church in Hixson, Tenn., with an interfaith ceremony, led by Tom Judge, a chaplain at DePaul University in Chicago.

\f2\fs20   ''That was hopeful to me,'' Ms. Wittman said. ''It was clear to both of us that we were interested because we were making plans for a couple months later.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mr. Ziauddin says that he gave her a peck on the cheek that night when they parted, but a few days later, when she drove up to his place, in Easthampton, Mass., they had a proper kiss over takeout food and amid the boxes strewn around the condo he had just moved into.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Ms. Wittman, 42, was at the time the pastor of a Lutheran church in Glastonbury, Conn. She is now the chaplain at St. Anthony Summit Medical Center in Frisco, Colo. She graduated from Concordia University in St. Paul, Minn., and received a Master of Divinity from the University of Chicago as well as a certificate of advanced theological studies from Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, Calif. A previous marriage ended in divorce.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mr. Ziauddin, 41, was then an actuary for risk management at the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company in Springfield, Mass. He graduated from Tulane and received a master's degree in quantitative and computational finance from the Georgia Institute of Technology. He has plans to apply to graduate school in applied statistics or 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone .
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mr. Ziauddin, who is Muslim, said initially he was hesitant to pursue the relationship because of their religious differences, but with time he was able to let that go. ''The differences just seemed of less and less concern the more I got to know her,'' he said. ''We were compatible.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Ms. Wittman, who will take her husband's name, said that she realized she was in love with him when he was coaching her in how to play tennis. ''It was a few lessons in,'' she said. ''I remember we were on the court, and I was having a hard time listening to the instructions because I was so interested in him.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   In 2016, she decided to change career directions by beginning a residency as a chaplain in Aurora, Colo., and the couple moved West.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   They ended up in Frisco, a ski town near four resorts, including Breckenridge and Copper Mountain, and it was in that town that they intended to be married. They had planned for 110 guests, but decided after the arrival of coronavirus, that a wedding near where his parents live, and close enough for her parents to drive to, would be a better option.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   So on July 25, the couple were married in Chattanooga, Tenn., in a wedding that began with a Muslim ceremony led by Imam Sadek Alsouqi, at the Islamic Society of Greater Chattanooga, and concluded at Trinity Lutheran Church in Hixson, Tenn., with an interfaith ceremony, led by Tom Judge, a chaplain at DePaul University in Chicago.

\cf0 In the last five years, dozens of schools have popped up offering an unusual promise: Even humanities graduates can learn how to code in a few months and join the high-paying digital economy. Students and their hopeful parents shelled out as much as $26,000 seeking to jump-start a career.\
But the coding boot-camp field now faces a sobering moment, as two large schools have announced plans to shut down this year \'97 despite backing by major for-profit education companies, Kaplan and the Apollo Education Group, the parent of the University of Phoenix.\
The closings are a sign that years of heady growth led to a boot-camp glut, and that the field could be in the early stages of a shakeout.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \'93You can imagine this becoming a big industry, but not for 90 companies,\'94 said Michael Horn, a principal consultant at 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Entangled Solutions
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , an education research and consulting firm.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 The demand from employers is shifting and the schools must adapt. Many boot camps have not evolved beyond courses in basic web development, but companies are now often looking for more advanced coding skills.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 One of the casualties, 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Dev Bootcamp
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , was a pioneer. It started in San Francisco in 2012 and grew to six schools with more than 3,000 graduates. Only three years ago, Kaplan, the biggest supplier of test-preparation courses, bought Dev Bootcamp and pledged bold expansion.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 It is now closing at the end of the year.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Also closing is 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 The Iron Yard
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , a boot camp that was founded in Greenville, S.C., in 2013 and swiftly spread to 15 campuses, from Las Vegas to Washington, D.C. Its main financial backer is the Apollo Education Group.\
Since 2013, the number of boot camp schools in the United States has tripled to more than 90, and the number of graduates will reach nearly 23,000 in 2017, a tenfold jump from 2013, according to 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Course Report
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , which tracks the industry.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Tarlin Ray, who became president of Dev Bootcamp in April, said in an email that the school offered \'93a high-quality program\'94 that helped thousands of people join the high-tech economy. \'93But we were simply unable to find a sustainable business model,\'94 he wrote.\
Iron Yard echoed that theme. In an email, Lelia King, a spokeswoman, said that while students benefited, the company was \'93ultimately unable to sustain our current business model.\'94\
Boot camp courses, aimed at adults, vary in length and cost. Some can take 26 weeks or more, and tuition can reach $26,000. The average course length is just over 14 weeks, and the average cost is $11,400, according to Course Report.\
The successful schools, analysts say, will increasingly be ones that expand their programs to suit the changing needs of employers. Some have already added courses like 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone , artificial intelligence, digital marketing and project management. Other steps include tailoring courses for corporations, which need to update the skills of their workers, or develop online courses.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Ryan Craig, a managing director at 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 University Ventures
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , which invests in education start-ups, including Galvanize, a large boot camp, predicted that the overall market would still grow. But students, he said, would become more concentrated in the schools with the best reputations and job placement rates.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 The promise of boot camps is that they are on-ramps to good jobs. But rapid expansion into new cities can leave little time to forge ties with nearby companies, the hiring market for boot camp graduates, said Liz Eggleston, co-founder of Course Report.\
That message was underlined by Mr. Ray of Dev Bootcamp. While he would not discuss specifics about what happened to his school, he wrote: \'93We do think that as the boot camp industry continues on, it will be important to create stronger alignment with employers.\'94\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Some boot camps cater directly to corporate customers. 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 General Assembly
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , which operates 20 coding campuses and has raised $119 million in venture financing, now works with more than 100 large companies on programs to equip their employees with digital skills.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \'93Employer-paid programs are now a big slice of the pie\'94 for General Assembly, about half of its business, said Jake Schwartz, its chief executive.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 At 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Galvanize
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , Jim Deters, the chairman, said he recently stepped aside as chief executive to concentrate on getting more business from corporations. This year, Galvanize will have 2,000 students who pay their own tuition, and about 1,500 people in its programs tailored to \'97 and paid for by \'97 companies like IBM, Allstate and McKesson. \'93The business re-skilling marketplace has become one of our biggest drivers of growth,\'94 Mr. Deters said.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Kaplan is not closing Metis, a 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  boot camp, which has corporate training programs.\
Several boot camps are deploying \'93blended\'94 models with both in-person and online teaching. Entirely online courses, in theory, could deliver rapid, profitable growth. But that is a different model from the immersive, face-to-face learning that has been the hallmark of the boot camp experience.\
\'93Online boot camp is an oxymoron,\'94 said Mr. Craig of University Ventures. \'93No one has figured out how to do that yet.\'94\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 The 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Flatiron School
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  in New York may have discovered one path. Founded in 2012, Flatiron has a single campus in downtown Manhattan and its main offering is a 15-week immersive coding program with a $15,000 price tag. More than 95 percent of its 1,000 graduates there have landed coding jobs.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 In late 2015, the co-founders, Adam Enbar and Avi Flombaum, decided to try an online-only offering, Learn.co. The tuition is $1,500 a month. Students go at their own pace, and on average complete the course in seven months, putting in about 800 hours. Tuition charges stop after eight months \'97 and there are instructors online 16 hours a day for help and advice.\
Kailee Gray, 29, a math instructor in Fargo, N.D., seeking a career change, said she had communicated daily with instructors and participated in online study groups. On the night before a job interview, she recalled \'93getting panicked\'94 and sent a message to an instructor. Soon, Rebekah Rombom, vice president for career services at Flatiron, was on the phone for a reassuring pep talk.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Ms. Gray landed the job \'97 as have more than 95 percent of the students so far in Flatiron\'92s online program, according to 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 the company and an outside audit report
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone .\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 It seems a particularly high rate for an online course, especially when compared with free online courses, which only a small proportion of students complete.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 The school was the subject of a Harvard Business School case study, 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 published this year
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , which found that the early success of the online-only course has \'93expanded strategic options for Flatiron.\'94\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 But just how much is uncertain. \'93It\'92s pretty clear that they can do it at the scale they have,\'94 said Thomas Eisenmann, a professor and lead author of the study. \'93What\'92s not clear is whether it can go from a hundred or a few hundred to thousands and thousands.\'94\

\f2\fs20 \cf0 SAN FRANCISCO \'97 The retail landscape is littered with 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 the casualties of changing consumer behavior
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone . Shoppers are bargain hunting online, department stores are struggling, and once-mainstay brands are closing out permanently.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Then there is Stitch Fix, a mail-order clothing service that offers customers little choice in what garments they receive, and shies away from discounts for brand name dresses, pants and accessories.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Despite a business model that seems to defy conventional wisdom, Stitch Fix continues to grow.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 For the fiscal year that ended last July, the company recorded sales of $730 million. It has been profitable since 2014 and has raised just $42 million from outside investors, a relatively modest sum for a high-flying Silicon Valley start-up.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 And while Stitch Fix executives say they have no specific plans to go public, the company is well positioned to file for an initial public offering as soon as this year.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Should Stitch Fix go public, it would be the biggest retail offering since Etsy two years ago. Perhaps more important, it would be a Silicon Valley rarity: a profitable company that did not raise money at a sky-high valuation, and one that could potentially tap the public markets at a price many times greater than its current value.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Stitch Fix is not the first company to try this business model. Similar start-ups, from clothing rival Trunk Club to the cosmetics specialist Birchbox, have found a market mailing consumers a grab bag of items and offering free returns for anything unwanted.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 But many such start-ups have had trouble keeping costs down, and customers around. Nordstrom, which bought Trunk Club in 2014 for a reported $350 million, wrote down nearly $200 million from the business\'92 value last year.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93Those businesses have mostly struggled to grow and remain profitable over a long period of time,\'94 said Mark Cohen, a professor at Columbia Business School who previously served as chief executive of Sears Canada. \'93Will a loyalist want to receive this every month? Is anyone interested in consuming this much apparel and accessories?\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 So far, Stitch Fix has found success where other online clothing start-ups have struggled. To the company\'92s founder, Katrina Lake, success comes down to delivering what consumers want: making it easier to shop.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93There\'92s been a lot of innovation around being the cheapest or fastest,\'94 she said in an interview at one of the company\'92s warehouses south of San Francisco. In her view, what was important was helping customers find clothing they liked without taking lengthy shopping trips and returning dozens of items.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Stitch Fix was founded in 2011 and was initially run out of Ms. Lake\'92s apartment in Cambridge, Mass. At first the company catered only to women, but has since expanded to offer men\'92s clothing, plus sizes and maternity wear.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Each box contains a handful of selections from trendy brands like Citizens of Humanity, Scotch & Soda and Barbour. Up next is a \'93luxe\'94 offering featuring clothes from higher-end labels like Theory, with price tags going from $150 to about $500 per item.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Expansion plans like that drive home the diverging fortunes of struggling traditional retailers and fast-growing online rivals.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Online retailers who sell luxury products for less are undercutting sales at high-end department stores like Neiman Marcus. Nordstrom recently announced layoffs and told investors it plans to focus on e-commerce, despite its Trunk Club write-down. And J. Crew, which has hundreds of stores around the country, has suffered three straight years of losses and is deeply in debt.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 While early e-commerce start-ups like One Kings Lane, Gilt Groupe and Fab were failures for investors, the category has picked up steam in the past few years as traditional retailers have looked to start-ups to lift their businesses. Jet sold itself to Walmart for $3 billion. Last year the subscription razor service Dollar Shave Club sold to Unilever for $1 billion. And the online pet store 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Chewy.com
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  was acquired by PetSmart, reportedly for more than $3 billion. Some start-ups have also moved away from models that compete for customers on price or rely on fads, like flash sales, for traction.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Stitch Fix\'92s pitch is straightforward enough: Trust the company to pick out your tops, bottoms, shoes or accessories for you.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 When customers sign up, they fill out an extensive form detailing style preferences, clothing needs and price points. The start-up\'92s algorithms then churn out a set of potential choices, which one of its 3,400 stylists \'97 most of them part time \'97 then tailors to the individual customer before sending out five items in a package. Anything a customer does not want can be returned free of charge, and customers receive a 25 percent discount when they buy everything in the box.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 At the company\'92s warehouse, Eric Colson, formerly a top data scientist at Netflix, spoke to the role that

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Mr. Colson excitedly illustrated on whiteboards how the company\'92s systems can narrow down a broad range of women\'92s pants to a relative few that each individual customer is statistically likely to keep.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93Customers say, \'91This thing you picked out for me, I would never have picked it out for myself,\'92\'94 he said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Algorithms have even cut the number of steps needed for workers to pick out clothes for individual clients.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93Some people call this the \'91Moneyball\'92 of fashion,\'94 said 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Bill Gurley of the venture capital firm Benchmark
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , who sits on Stitch Fix\'92s board. \'93The level of 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  done at this company compared to the incumbent set is incomparable.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 But that data-driven approach has also been yoked to Ms. Lake\'92s insistence on running a financially healthy company. Given her early troubles raising money from outside investors, Ms. Lake worked toward becoming profitable early.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93We had a \'91lean plan\'92 and a \'91lean-lean plan,\'92\'94 Ms. Lake said of the business model.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Stitch Fix declined to say what percentage of items are returned.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Running so cheaply meant not taking out ads during Stitch Fix\'92s early days. But word of mouth helped the company grow \'97 and eventually drew investors like Mr. Gurley, whose interest was piqued by the number of assistants at his firm who swore by the service.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Yet the question remains whether customers who are initially thrilled by receiving a customized box of clothing will remain customers for months or even years.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Lauren Rivellino, an optometrist in Charlotte, Va., was a Stitch Fix enthusiast when she subscribed in 2015. She loved trying clothes on at home rather than a poorly lit dressing room, and most items were flattering and reflected her style.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 But a year later, Ms. Rivellino stopped using the service. \'93I really have nothing bad to say about them,\'94 she said in a recent email. \'93I just don\'92t shop a lot.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Stitch Fix executives declined to share their retention statistics, but claim that they are above industry averages. Ms. Lake and Mr. Colson acknowledged that clients stop using the service for a variety of reasons, from dissatisfaction to their closets simply filling up.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 But the two argued that the company can analyze scores of data points to figure out ways to coax these customers back to the fold.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 SAN FRANCISCO -- The retail landscape is littered with the casualties of changing consumer behavior. Shoppers are bargain hunting online, department stores are struggling, and once-mainstay brands are closing out permanently.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Then there is Stitch Fix, a mail-order clothing service that offers customers little choice in what garments they receive, and shies away from discounts for brand name dresses, pants and accessories. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Despite a business model that seems to defy conventional wisdom, Stitch Fix continues to grow.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   For the fiscal year that ended last July, the company recorded sales of $730 million. It has been profitable since 2014 and has raised just $42 million from outside investors, a relatively modest sum for a high-flying Silicon Valley start-up.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   And while Stitch Fix executives say they have no specific plans to go public, the company is well positioned to file for an initial public offering as soon as this year.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Should Stitch Fix go public, it would be the biggest retail offering since Etsy two years ago. Perhaps more important, it would be a Silicon Valley rarity: a profitable company that did not raise money at a sky-high valuation, and one that could potentially tap the public markets at a price many times greater than its current value.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Stitch Fix is not the first company to try this business model. Similar start-ups, from clothing rival Trunk Club to the cosmetics specialist Birchbox, have found a market mailing consumers a grab bag of items and offering free returns for anything unwanted.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   But many such start-ups have had trouble keeping costs down, and customers around. Nordstrom, which bought Trunk Club in 2014 for a reported $350 million, wrote down nearly $200 million from the business' value last year.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Those businesses have mostly struggled to grow and remain profitable over a long period of time,'' said Mark Cohen, a professor at Columbia Business School who previously served as chief executive of Sears Canada. ''Will a loyalist want to receive this every month? Is anyone interested in consuming this much apparel and accessories?''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   So far, Stitch Fix has found success where other online clothing start-ups have struggled. To the company's founder, Katrina Lake, success comes down to delivering what consumers want: making it easier to shop.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''There's been a lot of innovation around being the cheapest or fastest,'' she said in an interview at one of the company's warehouses south of San Francisco. In her view, what was important was helping customers find clothing they liked without taking lengthy shopping trips and returning dozens of items.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Stitch Fix was founded in 2011 and was initially run out of Ms. Lake's apartment in Cambridge, Mass. At first the company catered only to women, but has since expanded to offer men's clothing, plus sizes and maternity wear.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Each box contains a handful of selections from trendy brands like Citizens of Humanity, Scotch & Soda and Barbour. Up next is a ''luxe'' offering featuring clothes from higher-end labels like Theory, with price tags going from $150 to about $500 per item.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Expansion plans like that drive home the diverging fortunes of struggling traditional retailers and fast-growing online rivals.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Online retailers who sell luxury products for less are undercutting sales at high-end department stores like Neiman Marcus. Nordstrom recently announced layoffs and told investors it plans to focus on e-commerce, despite its Trunk Club write-down. And J. Crew, which has hundreds of stores around the country, has suffered three straight years of losses and is deeply in debt.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   While early e-commerce start-ups like One Kings Lane, Gilt Groupe and Fab were failures for investors, the category has picked up steam in the past few years as traditional retailers have looked to start-ups to lift their businesses. Jet sold itself to Walmart for $3 billion. Last year the subscription razor service Dollar Shave Club sold to Unilever for $1 billion. And the online pet store Chewy.com was acquired by PetSmart, reportedly for more than $3 billion. Some start-ups have also moved away from models that compete for customers on price or rely on fads, like flash sales, for traction.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Stitch Fix's pitch is straightforward enough: Trust the company to pick out your tops, bottoms, shoes or accessories for you.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   When customers sign up, they fill out an extensive form detailing style preferences, clothing needs and price points. The start-up's algorithms then churn out a set of potential choices, which one of its 3,400 stylists -- most of them part time -- then tailors to the individual customer before sending out five items in a package. Anything a customer does not want can be returned free of charge, and customers receive a 25 percent discount when they buy everything in the box.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   At the company's warehouse, Eric Colson, formerly a top data scientist at Netflix, spoke to the role that 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  -- once the province of high-tech giants -- plays in nearly every aspect of the Stitch Fix business.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mr. Colson excitedly illustrated on whiteboards how the company's systems can narrow down a broad range of women's pants to a relative few that each individual customer is statistically likely to keep.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Customers say, 'This thing you picked out for me, I would never have picked it out for myself,''' he said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Algorithms have even cut the number of steps needed for workers to pick out clothes for individual clients.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Some people call this the 'Moneyball' of fashion,'' said Bill Gurley of the venture capital firm Benchmark, who sits on Stitch Fix's board. ''The level of 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  done at this company compared to the incumbent set is incomparable.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   But that data-driven approach has also been yoked to Ms. Lake's insistence on running a financially healthy company. Given her early troubles raising money from outside investors, Ms. Lake worked toward becoming profitable early.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''We had a 'lean plan' and a 'lean-lean plan,''' Ms. Lake said of the business model.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Stitch Fix declined to say what percentage of items are returned.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Running so cheaply meant not taking out ads during Stitch Fix's early days. But word of mouth helped the company grow -- and eventually drew investors like Mr. Gurley, whose interest was piqued by the number of assistants at his firm who swore by the service.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 In the last five years, dozens of schools have popped up offering an unusual promise: Even humanities graduates can learn how to code in a few months and join the high-paying digital economy. Students and their hopeful parents shelled out as much as $26,000 seeking to jump-start a career.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 But the coding boot-camp field now faces a sobering moment, as two large schools have announced plans to shut down this year -- despite backing by major for-profit education companies, Kaplan and the Apollo Education Group, the parent of the University of Phoenix. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The closings are a sign that years of heady growth led to a boot-camp glut, and that the field could be in the early stages of a shakeout.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''You can imagine this becoming a big industry, but not for 90 companies,'' said Michael Horn, a principal consultant at Entangled Solutions, an education research and consulting firm.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The demand from employers is shifting and the schools must adapt. Many boot camps have not evolved beyond courses in basic web development, but companies are now often looking for more advanced coding skills.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   One of the casualties, Dev Bootcamp, was a pioneer. It started in San Francisco in 2012 and grew to six schools with more than 3,000 graduates. Only three years ago, Kaplan, the biggest supplier of test-preparation courses, bought Dev Bootcamp and pledged bold expansion.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   It is now closing at the end of the year.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Also closing is The Iron Yard, a boot camp that was founded in Greenville, S.C., in 2013 and swiftly spread to 15 campuses, from Las Vegas to Washington, D.C. Its main financial backer is the Apollo Education Group.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Since 2013, the number of boot camp schools in the United States has tripled to more than 90, and the number of graduates will reach nearly 23,000 in 2017, a tenfold jump from 2013, according to Course Report, which tracks the industry.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Tarlin Ray, who became president of Dev Bootcamp in April, said in an email that the school offered ''a high-quality program'' that helped thousands of people join the high-tech economy. ''But we were simply unable to find a sustainable business model,'' he wrote.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Iron Yard echoed that theme. In an email, Lelia King, a spokeswoman, said that while students benefited, the company was ''ultimately unable to sustain our current business model.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Boot camp courses, aimed at adults, vary in length and cost. Some can take 26 weeks or more, and tuition can reach $26,000. The average course length is just over 14 weeks, and the average cost is $11,400, according to Course Report.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The successful schools, analysts say, will increasingly be ones that expand their programs to suit the changing needs of employers. Some have already added courses like 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone , artificial intelligence, digital marketing and project management. Other steps include tailoring courses for corporations, which need to update the skills of their workers, or develop online courses.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Ryan Craig, a managing director at University Ventures, which invests in education start-ups, including Galvanize, a large boot camp, predicted that the overall market would still grow. But students, he said, would become more concentrated in the schools with the best reputations and job placement rates.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The promise of boot camps is that they are on-ramps to good jobs. But rapid expansion into new cities can leave little time to forge ties with nearby companies, the hiring market for boot camp graduates, said Liz Eggleston, co-founder of Course Report.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   That message was underlined by Mr. Ray of Dev Bootcamp. While he would not discuss specifics about what happened to his school, he wrote: ''We do think that as the boot camp industry continues on, it will be important to create stronger alignment with employers.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Some boot camps cater directly to corporate customers. General Assembly, which operates 20 coding campuses and has raised $119 million in venture financing, now works with more than 100 large companies on programs to equip their employees with digital skills.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Employer-paid programs are now a big slice of the pie'' for General Assembly, about half of its business, said Jake Schwartz, its chief executive.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   At Galvanize, Jim Deters, the chairman, said he recently stepped aside as chief executive to concentrate on getting more business from corporations. This year, Galvanize will have 2,000 students who pay their own tuition, and about 1,500 people in its programs tailored to -- and paid for by -- companies like IBM, Allstate and McKesson. ''The business re-skilling marketplace has become one of our biggest drivers of growth,'' Mr. Deters said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Kaplan is not closing Metis, a 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  boot camp, which has corporate training programs.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Several boot camps are deploying ''blended'' models with both in-person and online teaching. Entirely online courses, in theory, could deliver rapid, profitable growth. But that is a different model from the immersive, face-to-face learning that has been the hallmark of the boot camp experience.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Online boot camp is an oxymoron,'' said Mr. Craig of University Ventures. ''No one has figured out how to do that yet.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The Flatiron School in New York may have discovered one path. Founded in 2012, Flatiron has a single campus in downtown Manhattan and its main offering is a 15-week immersive coding program with a $15,000 price tag. More than 95 percent of its 1,000 graduates there have landed coding jobs.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   In late 2015, the co-founders, Adam Enbar and Avi Flombaum, decided to try an online-only offering, Learn.co. The tuition is $1,500 a month. Students go at their own pace, and on average complete the course in seven months, putting in about 800 hours. Tuition charges stop after eight months -- and there are instructors online 16 hours a day for help and advice.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Kailee Gray, 29, a math instructor in Fargo, N.D., seeking a career change, said she had communicated daily with instructors and participated in online study groups. On the night before a job interview, she recalled ''getting panicked'' and sent a message to an instructor. Soon, Rebekah Rombom, vice president for career services at Flatiron, was on the phone for a reassuring pep talk.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Ms. Gray landed the job -- as have more than 95 percent of the students so far in Flatiron's online program, according to the company and an outside audit report.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   It seems a particularly high rate for an online course, especially when compared with free online courses, which only a small proportion of students complete.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The school was the subject of a Harvard Business School case study, published this year, which found that the early success of the online-only course has ''expanded strategic options for Flatiron.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   But just how much is uncertain. ''It's pretty clear that they can do it at the scale they have,'' said Thomas Eisenmann, a professor and lead author of the study. ''What's not clear is whether it can go from a hundred or a few hundred to thousands and thousands.''

\f2\fs20 \cf0 More owners are permanently shutting their doors after new lockdown orders, realizing that there may be no end in sight to the crisis.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 On the last Friday of June, after Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas said that bars across the state would have to shut down a second time because coronavirus cases were skyrocketing, Mick Larkin decided he had had enough. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   No matter that Mr. Larkin, an owner of a karaoke club in Wichita Falls, Texas, had just paid $1,000 for perishable goods and protective equipment in anticipation of the weekend rush. No matter that the frozen margarita machine was full, that 175 plastic syringes with booze-infused Jell-O were in place, or that there were masks for staff members and hand sanitizer for guests.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   That day, June 26, Mr. Larkin and his partner dumped what they had just bought into the trash and decided to close their club, Krank It Karaoke, for good.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''We did everything we were supposed to do,'' Mr. Larkin said. ''When he shut us down again, and after I put out all that money to meet their rules, I just said, 'I can't keep doing this.'''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   It was harrowing enough for small businesses -- the bars, dental care practices, small law firms, day care centers and other storefronts that dot the streets and corners of every American town and city -- to have to shut down after state officials imposed lockdowns in March to contain the pandemic. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   But the resurgence of the virus, especially in states such as Texas, Florida and California that had begun to reopen, has introduced a far darker reality for many small businesses: Their temporary closures might become permanent.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Nearly 66,000 businesses have folded since March 1, according to data from Yelp, which provides a platform for local businesses to advertise their services and has been tracking announcements of closings posted on its site. From June 15 to June 29, the most recent period for which data is available, businesses were closing permanently at a higher rate than in the previous three months, Yelp found. During the same period, permanent closures increased by 3 percent overall, accounting for roughly 14 percent of total closures since March.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Researchers at Harvard believe the rates of business closures are likely to be even higher. They estimated that nearly 110,000 small businesses across the country had decided to shut down permanently between early March and early May, based on data collected in weekly surveys by Alignable, a social media network for small-business owners.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Christopher Stanton, an associate professor at Harvard Business School who was one of the researchers, said it was difficult to accurately gauge how many small businesses were closing because, once they shut their doors for good, the owners were hard to reach.  He added that it could take up to a year before government officials knew the true toll the pandemic was taking on small businesses.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   At the moment, 39 states continue to record growing numbers of new cases daily.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   It is not clear how many of the businesses Yelp is tracking count as ''small'' -- defined by the Small Business Administration as those with 500 or fewer employees. But the company found that, among the tracked businesses -- which include restaurants, retailers and other independent, consumer-facing operations -- retail businesses, led by beauty supply stores, have been closing at the highest rate since the pandemic began. Restaurants are the next hardest-hit group.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Small businesses account for 44 percent of all U.S. economic activity, according to the S.B.A., and closures on such an immense scale could devastate the country's economic growth. If they were grouped together, small businesses would be among the country's biggest employers, said Satyam Khanna, a resident fellow at the Institute for Corporate Governance and Finance at New York University School of Law who has written about the effects of the pandemic on small businesses.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   So when small businesses close en masse, an entire sector of the economy suffers, Mr. Khanna said. There is lower cash flow, higher debt and more unemployment. ''That leads to a big drag on the eventual recovery,'' he said. ''Because they are such an important source of jobs, losing them the way we are losing them now is going to make things far worse than they otherwise need to be.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Because small businesses depend heavily on foot traffic and operate on thin margins, they are especially vulnerable to the ripple effects of a widespread shutdown.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   For nearly two decades, Rich Tokheim and his wife sold sports memorabilia -- hats, T-shirts, coffee mugs and other trinkets -- to fans in Omaha at their store, The Dugout. Since 2011, The Dugout has occupied prime real estate across the street from the city's 24,000-seat baseball stadium, which usually hosts the College World Series each spring.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The 2020 World Series was canceled in March. In the weeks that came after, other sporting events were scrapped -- starting with college sports and extending to professional leagues that have struggled to relaunch their activities.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mr. Tokheim, 58, watched his business fall off with growing unease, but it was only after a friendly chat with a retired college athletic director in May that the gravity of his situation hit home. He was already worried about the state of the virus in Nebraska, and whether there was enough tracking. Then the athletic director predicted that if college football was canceled for the year, it would be the end of Division I sports as a whole.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''That really put me in overdrive,'' Mr. Tokheim said. He negotiated an early exit on his store lease and announced a clearance sale at the store. The Dugout closed for good on June 30.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The government's Paycheck Protection Program, rolled out in April and administered by the S.B.A., earmarked $660 billion of aid for small businesses, but stipulated that a loan would be forgiven only if most of it was used to pay employee wages for eight weeks. The rules were later relaxed, but in a sign of how many small-business owners did not feel confident that they would be on steady ground by the time repayment was due, roughly $130 billion of aid money remained untapped when the program ended in June.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Even for those who took a P.P.P. loan, survival is no guarantee. Nick Muscari, a 38-year-old restaurateur in Lubbock, Texas, received one. His restaurant, Nick's Sports Grill and Lounge, had been the culmination of Mr. Muscari's life's work -- his years of toil as a waiter, pizza cook and manager at restaurants and bars beginning in his teenage years. Three years ago, he bought out the two partners who helped him start the restaurant in 2010. He considered it a crowning achievement, but to do so, he had to borrow money. He still owes a bank $80,000.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mr. Muscari tried to ride out the spring lockdown that temporarily shuttered his restaurant with the help of the P.P.P. money. But when the state's second closure order took effect on June 26, he decided to close for good.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''It had been in the back of our minds, just like, you know, if this happens again, can we make it?'' Mr. Muscari said. ''We were following all the rules and people were spread out. We never had anybody catch the virus in our establishment."
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mr. Muscari, with the business closed and its 30 employees jobless, has nothing left but his house and his car. He also expects his landlord to try to sue him for the eight years' worth of rent he is contracted to pay on his defunct restaurant's space.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Many small businesses are also finding it onerous keep up with constantly changing local guidelines, while others are deciding that no matter what their local officials say, it just is not safe to keep going. Gabriel Gordon, the owner of a tiny but popular barbecue restaurant in Seal Beach, Calif., decided to close permanently after studying the restaurant's layout. He had determined that the kitchen would never be safe for multiple staff members to occupy at once while the virus was still active in the area.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''It's essentially two hallways that are 11 feet wide,'' Mr. Gordon said, describing the shape of the restaurant, Beachwood BBQ. ''There are food trucks that are larger than my kitchen.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Whatever the specific reasons may be for each closure, Justin Norman, Yelp's vice president of 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone , said that the federal government should offer small businesses more help. Mr. Norman said Yelp was concerned about the effects of small-business closures, especially those owned by people of color, on society. Yelp, however, also has a financial interest in maintaining a robust small-business environment, because it relies heavily on advertising by businesses on its platform.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''The time is right now to inject more capital or we may lose them forever,'' Mr. Norman said. ''It's going to make our economies worse, it's going to make our communities worse.''

\f2\fs20 Many small businesses are also finding it onerous keep up with constantly changing local guidelines, while others are deciding that no matter what their local officials say, it just is not safe to keep going. Gabriel Gordon, the owner of a tiny but popular barbecue restaurant in Seal Beach, Calif., decided to close permanently after studying the restaurant\'92s layout. He had determined that the kitchen would never be safe for multiple staff members to occupy at once while the virus was still active in the area.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93It\'92s essentially two hallways that are 11 feet wide,\'94 Mr. Gordon said, describing the shape of the restaurant, Beachwood BBQ. \'93There are food trucks that are larger than my kitchen.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Whatever the specific reasons may be for each closure, Justin Norman, Yelp\'92s vice president of 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone , said that the federal government should offer small businesses more help. Mr. Norman said Yelp was concerned about the effects of small-business closures, especially those owned by people of color, on society. Yelp, however, also has a financial interest in maintaining a robust small-business environment, because it relies heavily on advertising by businesses on its platform.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93The time is right now to inject more capital or we may lose them forever,\'94 Mr. Norman said. \'93It\'92s going to make our economies worse, it\'92s going to make our communities worse.\'94

\f2\fs20 \cf0 How large is the so-called skills gap?
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The Manpower Group, a human resources consulting firm, says the gap, which is often defined as the difference in job skills required and the actual skills possessed by employees, is a chasm. Of the more than 42,000 employers the firm surveyed last year, 40 percent said they were having difficulties filling roles, the highest level since 2007. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   While some experts say that businesses bemoaning the quality of talent emerging from colleges is a perennial complaint, no one argues the importance of developing programs to meet the needs of employers in a fast-changing workplace.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''The economy and employers have changed,'' said Louis Soares, vice president of the American Council on Education. ''They want you to come in with a hot skill set, ready to go. Colleges are paying attention at different levels to what that means and trying to develop programs.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Some are doing that better than others. ''Some institutions are very good,'' said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. ''They have their ear to the ground, they're listening to local employers and paying attention to what they need.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Those needs may best be met by innovative and often collaborative programs, some of which, like the following, are upending traditional approaches and views on higher education.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Case Western Reserve University
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Creating 15- or 18-credit minors may be one of the more effective strategies for preparing students to enter high-demand fields. Because a minor requires fewer credits than a major and few, if any, prerequisites, these allow colleges to be more flexible and responsive to changing industries and emerging technologies.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Case Western's minor in applied 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone , for example, funnels students into this hot field from other disciplines. The students learn skills like data management, distributed computing, informatics and statistical analytics.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The Case minor has attracted students from majors like arts and sciences, engineering, business and health care. Graduates enter the market with an important and salable credential. A 2016 poll conducted by Gallup for the Business-Higher Education Forum found that 69 percent of employers expected that by 2021, candidates with 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  skills would get preference for jobs in their organizations.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   SUNY Certificate Program
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''How would you like to take a 12-week, 90-hour training program and be hired practically the minute after you've been handed your certificate?'' 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   That's the alluring promise from Farmingdale State College in New York for its new natural-gas technician certificate program, which is a partnership with National Grid, an energy provider.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The claim, made on an online blog, is not just hype. ''It's basically true,'' said Professor Marjaneh Issapour, who heads the program. ''Every one of our first 12 graduates got a job with National Grid.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   As the program grows, that may not be the case. But others could be interested in establishing such a talent pipeline, given the projected shortages in this and related technical fields.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   In a 2016 study of member organizations by the Associated Equipment Distributors, a trade association representing more than 800 equipment, distributors, manufacturers and industry-service companies, 50 percent reported that the inability to find qualified technicians hinders business growth and increases costs. More than 60 percent said that the skills gap made it difficult to meet customer demand.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The Farmingdale certificate program, which began last summer, already has over 130 applicants. ''It shows there's a need for these kinds of programs,'' Professor Issapour said. And while the college hopes some of the students return for associate's or bachelor's degrees, it realizes not all will. ''Not everyone is going to want to get a college degree,'' she said. ''And honestly, not everyone should.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   California Institute of Technology/Base 11
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   A collaboration with a major university and a nonprofit organization that identifies high-potential students who have shown interest but lack access and resources: That's the Caltech-Base 11 partnership, in which community college students from throughout California are mentored by Caltech graduate students through on-campus summer internships and semester-long programs.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The emphasis is on STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) majors in general and aerospace engineering, a major employer in the state, in particular. It has worked.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''We reviewed the students who have participated in both programs, and the vast majority have gone on to four-year colleges, and several of them have a full ride,'' said Beverley McKeon, the Caltech faculty director for the program.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Others, she said, have gotten high-profile internships, including one with the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Base 11, the nonprofit partner, offers two similar STEM career accelerator programs with the University of Southern California's School of Engineering and the University of California, Irvine.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Lake Area Technical Institute
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Tightly knit student cohorts in clearly defined graduation paths with close connections to their industry-trained instructors has been a formula for success,'' said Michael Cartney, president of the Lake Area Technical Institute in Watertown, S.D., in testimony to the Senate Commerce Committee in March.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   There's a reason Congress is listening to Mr. Cartney. President Barack Obama went there in 2015 to give the commencement address, and the Aspen Institute, a Washington-based educational and policy studies organization, gave the two-year college the 2017 Prize for Community College Excellence.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   In the announcement of the award in March, the organization cited the college's ''outstanding'' graduation rate, which is twice the national average compared with other community colleges, and its 99 percent job placement rate. The school's student-loan default rate is also about half the national average.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   A couple of key reasons: The college holds its 2,400 students accountable, as if they were in a job setting. And the college has close ties with local and regional industry (every major, for example, has an advisory board of industry professionals). Hence, they are able to develop programs that mirror the needs of employers.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mr. Cartney also takes a pragmatic view of education. ''We view college as a pathway,'' he said, ''not a destination.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Miami Dade College
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The college's new degree in data analytics is one of the first in Florida. But what's particularly innovative is the way the training is offered. The program begins with a certificate in business intelligence, progresses to an associate in science in business intelligence and culminates in a bachelor of science in data analytics.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The Labor Department defines this ''stackable'' approach as a sequence of credentials that can be accumulated to build up students' qualifications and help them move along a career path.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''This provides flexibility for those students who might need to be in the work force while in school,'' said Karen Elzey, vice president of the Business-Higher Education Forum, which was a partner in starting the program.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Dalhousie University
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The demand for dental hygienists in the United States is expected to grow nearly 20 percent in the next decade, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We can look north for good ideas on how to train students for this field, while also addressing the health needs of lower-income communities.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Each winter, dental hygiene students from Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, head up to the remote Labrador village of Forteau (population: about 450). The clinic there does not have the funding for a dental hygienist.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The students provide the majority of oral hygiene and education for the community. The students also see stark contrasts with what they would normally encounter in more-affluent communities (patients with tobacco staining, for example).
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The graduates of this internship are prepared for jobs in major Canadian population centers, although interestingly, the four Dalhousie dental hygiene students who went to Forteau this winter said they would prefer to practice in rural areas when they graduated.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The very existence of the Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology in Boston is a reminder that the challenge of maintaining a skilled work force is nothing new. Upon his death in 1790, Franklin left Boston an endowment to fund apprenticeships for young men under 25.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''I believe good apprentices are likely to make good citizens,'' he wrote in his will.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   That endowment was the seed money for what eventually became the college named in his honor. The college, in the city's South End, offers two- and four-year degrees in high-demand fields like health information technology, computer technology and automotive technology (in the planning stages: a program in driverless-car technology).
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Peter Haubrich, 23, is in many ways a typical Franklin student. He graduated in May 2016 with a bachelor of science in health information technology. A first-generation college student, he was raised by his grandmother in the Roxbury section of Boston. Five months after graduation, Mr. Haubrich says he was hired by UnitedHealthcare to work in its I.T. division for a starting salary of $65,000 and a $3,000 signing bonus.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mr. Haubrich said he is aware of the relationship of the college to Benjamin Franklin. ''I knew his dough started the school,'' he said. ''Seems to me they're definitely carrying out his mission.''

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The recent Black Lives Matter protests peaked on June 6, when half a million people turned out in nearly 550 places across the United States. That was a single day in more than a month of protests that still continue to today.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Four recent polls -- including one released this week by Civis Analytics, a 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  firm that works with businesses and Democratic campaigns -- suggest that about 15 million to 26 million people in the United States have participated in demonstrations over the death of George Floyd and others in recent weeks. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   These figures would make the recent protests the largest movement in the country's history, according to interviews with scholars and crowd-counting experts.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''I've never seen self-reports of protest participation that high for a specific issue over such a short period,'' said Neal Caren, associate professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who studies social movements in the United States.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   While it's possible that more people said they protested than actually did, even if only half told the truth, the surveys suggest more than seven million people participated in recent demonstrations.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The Women's March of 2017 had a turnout of about three million to five million people on a single day, but that was a highly organized event. Collectively, the recent Black Lives Matter protests -- more organic in nature -- appear to have far surpassed those numbers, according to polls.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Really, it's hard to overstate the scale of this movement,'' said Deva Woodly, an associate professor of politics at the New School.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Professor Woodly said that the civil rights marches in the 1960s were considerably smaller in number. ''If we added up all those protests during that period, we're talking about hundreds of thousands of people, but not millions,'' she said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Even protests to unseat government leadership or for independence typically succeed when they involve 3.5 percent of the population at their peak, according to a review of international protests by Erica Chenoweth, a professor at Harvard Kennedy School who co-directs the Crowd Counting Consortium, which collects data on crowd sizes of political protests.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Why This Is Different
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Precise turnout at protests is difficult to count and has led to some famous disputes. An amalgam of estimates from organizers, the police and local news reports often make up the official total.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   But tallies by teams of crowd counters are revealing numbers of extraordinary scale. On June 6, for example, at least 50,000 people turned out in Philadelphia, 20,000 in Chicago's Union Park and up to 10,000 on the Golden Gate Bridge, according to estimates by Edwin Chow, an associate professor at Texas State University, and researchers at the Crowd Counting Consortium.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Across the United States, there have been more than 4,700 demonstrations, or an average of 140 per day, since the first protests began in Minneapolis on May 26, according to a Times analysis. Turnout has ranged from dozens to tens of thousands in about 2,500 small towns and large cities.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''The geographic spread of protest is a really important characteristic and helps signal the depth and breadth of a movement's support,'' said Kenneth Andrews, a sociology professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   One of the reasons there have been protests in so many places in the United States is the backing of organizations like Black Lives Matter. While the group isn't necessarily directing each protest, it provides materials, guidance and a framework for new activists, Professor Woodly said. Those activists are taking to social media to quickly share protest details to a wide audience.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Black Lives Matter has been around since 2013, but there's been a big shift in public opinion about the movement as well as broader support for recent protests. A deluge of public support from organizations like the N.F.L. and NASCAR for Black Lives Matter may have also encouraged supporters who typically would sit on the sidelines to get involved.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The protests may also be benefiting from a country that is more conditioned to protesting. The adversarial stance that the Trump administration has taken on issues like guns, climate change and immigration has led to more protests than under any other presidency since the Cold War.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   According to a poll from The Washington Post and the Kaiser Family Foundation, one in five Americans said that they had participated in a protest since the start of the Trump administration, and 19 percent said they were new to protesting.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Who Is Protesting
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   More than 40 percent of counties in the United States -- at least 1,360 -- have had a protest. Unlike with past Black Lives Matter protests, nearly 95 percent of counties that had a protest recently are majority white, and nearly three-quarters of the counties are more than 75 percent white.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Without gainsaying the reality and significance of generalized white support for the movement in the early 1960s, the number of whites who were active in a sustained way in the struggle were comparatively few, and certainly nothing like the percentages we have seen taking part in recent weeks,'' said Douglas McAdam, an emeritus professor at Stanford University who studies social movements.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   According to the Civis Analytics poll, the movement appears to have attracted protesters who are younger and wealthier. The age group with the largest share of protesters was people under 35 and the income group with the largest share of protesters was those earning more than $150,000.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Half of those who said they protested said that this was their first time getting involved with a form of activism or demonstration. A majority said that they watched a video of police violence toward protesters or the Black community within the last year. And of those people, half said that it made them more supportive of the Black Lives Matter movement.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The protests are colliding with another watershed moment: the country's most devastating pandemic in modern history.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''With being home and not being able to do as much, that might be amplifying something that is already sort of critical, something that's already a powerful catalyst, and that is the video,'' said Daniel Q. Gillion, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania who has written several books on protests and politics.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''If you aren't moved by the George Floyd video, you have nothing in you,'' he said. ''And that catalyst can now be amplified by the fact that individuals probably have more time to engage in protest activity.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Besides the spike in demonstrations on Juneteeth, the number of protests has fallen considerably over the last two weeks according to the Crowd Counting Consortium.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   But the amount of change that the protests have been able to produce in such a short period of time is significant. In Minneapolis, the City Council pledged to dismantle its police department. In New York, lawmakers repealed a law that kept police disciplinary records secret. Cities and states across the country passed new laws banning chokeholds. Mississippi lawmakers voted to retire their state flag, which prominently includes a Confederate battle emblem.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''It looks, for all the world, like these protests are achieving what very few do: setting in motion a period of significant, sustained, and widespread social, political change,'' Professor McAdam said. ''We appear to be experiencing a social change tipping point -- that is as rare in society as it is potentially consequential.''Bedel Saget and Anjali Singhvi contributed reporting.

\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 ATLANTA \'97 I talk with Black voters every day, and what I hear keeps me up at night. Their faith in the political system is being eroded by voter suppression and the government\'92s negligent response to the pandemic. It breaks my heart that even Black women at church \'97 unfailing voters who rally their friends to turn out for every election \'97 have asked me, \'93Will our votes even be counted?\'94
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 These very real challenges require a whole new playbook. The problem is that Democrats have long treated Black people as though all they need is a gentle nudge the week before the election. Although Donald Trump won Georgia by 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 just 211,000
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  votes in 2016, some 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 900,000 eligible Black people
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  stayed home, a majority of them Atlanta residents. They were unconvinced that voting for the Democratic candidate would mean getting a president who represented them.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 This is a treasure trove of gettable voters who could overwhelm the political system. But Democrats have to persuade them, now more than ever, that voting will get them candidates up and down the ballot who care about things like health care expansion and ballot access. Unless Democrats fix their shortcomings, I fear we are on track for another catastrophic Election Day.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Part of the problem is the mismanagement of the pandemic. Georgia\'92s governor, Brian Kemp, defied science and logic when he started reopening the state on April 24. One model predicts the number of Covid-19 deaths will 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 quadruple
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  by August. Black people, who make up one-third of the population of Georgia but represented 83 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 percent
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  of coronavirus hospital patients in March and half of deaths, will continue to be disproportionately harmed.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 We\'92ve been screaming from mountaintops about the health care 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 crisis
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  in the state\'92s rural southwest for years; the region has a dire shortage of 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 doctors
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  and hospitals. A few majority-Black counties there have some of the highest death rates in the country.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The governor refused to fully expand Medicaid, leaving 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 nearly half a million people
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  without coverage (
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 36 percent of whom are Black and 22 percent Latino
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone ) and 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 $45 billion
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  on the table over the next decade. Now he plans to 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 slash funding
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  for state agencies, including the one that administers Medicaid, while enrollment is 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 projected to rise
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone .
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Republicans in Georgia and other Southern states are weaponizing the virus against Black people while ramping up efforts to suppress the vote.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Another part of the problem when it comes to mobilizing Black voters for November is that we haven\'92t addressed the sins of elections past. Southwestern Georgia is also where, long before anyone listened, Black people sounded the alarm that Mr. Kemp would try to steal the race for governor in 2018 from his Democratic rival, 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Stacey Abrams
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone . (Disclosure: my organization was founded by Ms. Abrams.)
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 As secretary of state overseeing his own election, Mr. Kemp served as umpire, player and scorekeeper, 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 purging 670,000
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  voters from the rolls in 2017 and, weeks before the 2018 election, withholding 53,000 more registrations under a spurious \'93
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 exact match\'94 law
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  (
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 70 percent
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  of those registrations were from Black people). Mr. Kemp also oversaw the shutdown of 214 precincts. Georgia had the 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 longest lines
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  in the country that year and the highest rejection rates of absentee and provisional ballots.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 A consultant linked to Mr. Kemp recommended that the board of elections in majority-Black Randolph County close seven of its nine polling locations. Why? The bathrooms in the polling locations lacked handrails, which the board claimed violated federal disability law. But the county had earlier refused to apply for money for the handrails when given the chance. It dropped the consolidation plan only after enormous attention from the news media.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f4\i\fs20 \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Such hyperlocal voter suppression
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  has become rampant 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 since
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  the Supreme Court 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 freed elections officials
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  in Georgia and other states from having to prove to the Justice Department in advance that their voting changes would not be discriminatory.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Mr. Kemp won the race by just 54,700 votes. If Jim Crow laws suppressed votes by forcing Black voters to guess the number of jelly beans in a jar, Dr. James Crow, with a Ph.D. in 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone , has erected a far more sophisticated suppression apparatus \'97 sophistication we have to match.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 But I have not seen any campaign, political party or elected official address voters\'92 pain at having their voices silenced. I know that pain has also spread to Alabama and Mississippi, where people were looking at Ms. Abrams\'92s candidacy as a glimpse into what was possible. They also saw the theft. And they saw the world move on as if a major crime against democracy had not been committed. That\'92s a problem.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 When we talk to college students now, the most common refrain we hear is, \'93I know my vote won\'92t count.\'94 My organization registered a staggering 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 18,000
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  17- and 18-year-olds in the months after the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., in February 2018. They flooded our office with earnest messages, wanting to learn how they could set up registration drives in their schools.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 We told them voting was a way to make material improvements in their lives by electing candidates like 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Lucy McBath
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , a Georgia representative who cares about gun reform. Then they watched as they were robbed of their civic voice, without any consequences. We have to address that if we want to win in November.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Action is even more urgent because the pandemic is being used as cover for more voter suppression.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 At the national level, the Republican National Committee 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 doubled
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  its litigation budget to file even more lawsuits to limit vote by mail access. Republicans aim to recruit up to 50,000 volunteers in 15 key states to monitor polling places and intimidate voters. Those efforts are aided by Donald Trump, who 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 appointed
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  a top Republican fund-raiser to serve as postmaster general, and is 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 withholding
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  a $10 billion loan from the Post Office, which desperately needs the money.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Georgia may be the center of all this. The state has created an 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 absentee ballot \'93fraud\'94
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  task force 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 made up of
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone mostly prosecutors and mostly Republicans to hinder voting by mail. \'93If a county official says my signature doesn\'92t match,\'94 Cathy Cox, a Democrat who is a former secretary of state for Georgia, 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 asked
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  a reporter, \'93is this task force going to show up with guns and badges at my office or my home?\'94
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Our office continues to receive a troubling number of inquiries about whether absentee ballots will even be counted. The question is common, and for good reason. We asked the 159 counties in Georgia where they\'92ll place drop boxes for those who want to avoid human contact during the pandemic. Only 78 provided locations and more than one-quarter won\'92t have drop boxes.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 These are monumental challenges that require a monumental response. We need the courage to act on a scale we\'92ve never seen before.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Democrats will win if they invest in an enormous marketing and organizing campaign that persuades Black people and young people to participate in our democracy. That campaign should answer uncomfortable questions about what happened in Georgia in 2018 and explain how this year will be different. Through millions of personal conversations, organizers can connect the dots between who makes decisions that puts their lives at risk and who can make things better. That\'92s how we can show young people grieving the killing of Ahmaud Arbery in South Georgia that voting is a way to create real change by electing new sheriffs and prosecutors.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 This campaign will require the progressive political industry to spend differently. Campaigns never balk at investing significant resources to court moderate white men. But when all the data is laid out about Black people, why does the political industry hesitate? Black people have long been the most loyal supporters of the Democratic Party \'97 indeed, no other major voting bloc 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 is as loyal
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  to a political party as Black people: Every 10 new Black voters nets eight Democratic votes, but the party gets only two net votes for every 10 new white, college-educated female voters. Democrats have to stop treating Black people as deserving of only mailers after Labor Day and invest in ways that make clear that Black people are the core of the multiracial coalition.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 We have to address voter suppression head on, identifying the hurdles and offering solutions now, not in October. My organization is 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 suing Georgia
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone over its practice of throwing out absentee ballots postmarked by Election Day but received after 7 p.m. that night. And for imposing a poll tax by sending absentee ballot applications to voters without prepaid returnable envelopes. This creates obstacles for people unwilling to go out during a pandemic to buy stamps or vote in person.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Vote-by-mail is not a panacea. While it is the safest option and it provides a paper trail, some states are using it in a way that creates hurdles. The next federal coronavirus legislation package must include $3.6 billion so states can expand their vote-by-mail initiatives and make voting easier. In addition, states should mount public education campaigns that include infographics and videos in multiple languages about how to cast ballots during the pandemic. In Georgia, the secretary of state must 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 urge
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  elections officials and lawmakers to increase funding to hire and train more staff members to deal with the increase in absentee ballots.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 We also need foundations, state and federal governments and the Democrats to help prevent and neutralize 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 disinformation campaigns
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone . Bad actors are online, sowing doubts about basic facts to undermine faith in the democratic process. To counter this, the industry ought to invest in trusted messengers to spread competing messages with good information, in addition to inspirational candidates who can alleviate voters\'92 concerns. My organization is doing its part. We\'92re building mobile video games to educate new and infrequent voters and are launching programs to monitor social media and provide media literacy that will compete for Black voters\'92s hearts, minds, attention and votes.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 A vibrant, robust democracy is our greatest weapon against authoritarian rule. And Black people have been 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 at the vanguard
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  of fighting for that democracy. This year, more than ever, we need overwhelming participation in our elections to neutralize voter suppression and halt the rise of despotic, unaccountable leaders. Our liberty and our lives are at stake.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The reported numbers leave out thousands of deaths clearly resulting from the pandemic.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Many supporters of President Trump believe that the figures for coronavirus fatalities are inflated, and Trump himself shared a tweet doubting the accuracy of some virus figures. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   He's right that the death toll seems off -- but not in the direction he would suggest. We've crunched the numbers, state by state, and it appears that somewhere around 100,000 to 110,000 Americans have already died as a result of the pandemic, rather than the 83,000 whose deaths have been attributed to the disease, Covid-19.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   That's my estimate reached with the help of a Harvard statistician, Rafael Irizarry, based on a comparison of death rates this spring with those in previous years. Some states have been largely unaffected -- death rates in some even appear to have dropped, perhaps because of less driving and fewer car accidents -- but others have seen huge surges in deaths.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Over all, in a bit more than two months, the United States lost more Americans to the coronavirus than died over seven decades in the Korean, Vietnam, Persian Gulf, Afghanistan and Iraq Wars.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Here's how we reached our estimates; they are not definitive, for they are based on preliminary data, and I invite discussion.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The starting point is that the cause of death is often uncertain. Most people who die don't get an autopsy, and many never had a coronavirus test. The precise number who died from Covid-19 is in some sense unknowable.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Still, one standard approach to measure the impact of a pandemic like this is to look at ''excess deaths,'' meaning mortality greater than the average for a particular time period.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   For example, for the seven weeks ending April 25 in the United States, about 70,000 more Americans died than is normal for those weeks (death is seasonal and normally declines over the course of spring and summer). That 70,000 figure for excess deaths does not include Connecticut, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, which were excluded because of missing or dubious data.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The official number of Covid-19 deaths in that period for the rest of the country was 49,100. That suggests an undercount of more than 20,000 coronavirus-related deaths as of April 25.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Add those 20,000 missed deaths to today's total of 83,000, and you already get more than 100,000 pandemic-related deaths. But the undercount probably continued after April 25, albeit at a lower rate.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   We don't have good enough mortality data to assess excess deaths in late April and early May, a period in which more than 30,000 Americans are reported to have died of Covid-19. Testing increased significantly, and over time doctors seemed more willing to list Covid-19 as the cause of death.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''There's probably less underreporting as time goes on,'' notes Robert N. Anderson, the chief of mortality statistics at the C.D.C.'s National Center for Health Statistics. In New York City, a study likewise found enormous underreporting in the first half of April, then gradually diminishing by the beginning of May.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   In the period we looked at, the undercount also diminished. Initially, there were more than twice as many excess deaths as reported coronavirus deaths, but by April 25 there were only 40 percent more. If the undercount thereafter were 10 percent, that would add a few thousand to the total, possibly bringing it closer to 110,000.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   These numbers are uncertain, but the implication is that somewhere around 25,000 more Americans died as a result of the pandemic than are recorded in the death tallies.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   This kind of analysis can't determine if they died directly from the virus or indirectly. Some presumably perished from heart attacks or strokes because they feared going to hospitals and delayed calling 911, or because ambulance services were stretched thin. In other words, a modest number presumably died because of the virus without being infected by it.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   One reason to think that a great majority of the excess deaths are directly caused by the virus is that in some states that seem to have meticulous reporting, such as Massachusetts, the number of excess deaths and the number of Covid-19 deaths are not so far apart.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Professor Irizarry, who is also chairman of the department of 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, notes that our new estimates are built on several layers of uncertainty. It typically takes two months for deaths to be reported in a reasonably complete way, so one critical issue is how to adjust for lags in reporting. The C.D.C. tries to estimate what the death total will eventually be based on incomplete reporting, and our estimates depend on its algorithms.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The mortality figures show enormous variation by state. Texas and California appear to have suffered more deaths from the 2018 flu epidemic than from the coronavirus so far. And according to the C.D.C. numbers, some states, including Arkansas, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota and Rhode Island, actually experienced fewer deaths than normal in the seven weeks ending April 25. The reason might be a decline in driving and a drop in accidental deaths.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Irizarry calculates that about 70 percent of excess deaths nationally derive from just five states: New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Massachusetts and Illinois.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The idea that official figures are undercounts is widely acknowledged. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci told a Senate health committee on Tuesday that he didn't know if the real death toll was 50 percent higher than the official figures, but that ''almost certainly it's higher.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Most frontline doctors will tell you that the numbers are grossly underreported,'' said Michael P. Jones, an emergency medicine physician who works at hospitals in the Bronx that were particularly hard hit. Especially in the early days, he said, many Covid-19 deaths were simply listed as some variant of ''respiratory failure'' or ''multisystem organ failure.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Dr. Alicia Skarimbas, who practices in New Jersey, said, ''We signed so many death certificates, we would get behind and take turns doing them.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Skarimbas said that she would list Covid-19 as the cause of death when that seemed obvious, but her partners might simply list ''respiratory failure'' unless there had been a positive test for the virus. Thus it was often random whether Covid-19 was listed as the cause of death.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The undercounting is a global problem, not just one in the United States. Dr. Christopher Murray of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington estimates that globally, excess deaths are about double the official Covid-19 death counts.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Excess deaths are often used to gauge mortality from an event or an epidemic. When Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico in 2017, the official death toll stood for a year at 64. But Irizarry and other scholars used a variety of techniques to calculate that excess deaths in the aftermath exceeded 1,000, perhaps by a wide margin. As a result of the statistical work, the official death toll is now 2,975.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Covid-19 will inevitably continue to kill people in the weeks ahead. Those who die over the next week or two have already been infected, perhaps several weeks ago. Dr. Tom Frieden, a former director of the C.D.C., notes that even if one could end all new infections, thousands would still die from infections already contracted.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Given the uncertainty and the lags in data, why go through this exercise of estimating deaths? Because flawed numbers based on an undercount are already a central part of the discussion, informing policy decisions, and Trump has made them so.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''We have saved thousands and thousands of lives,'' he said on May 1. ''Hopefully, we are going to come in below that 100,000 lives lost.'' In that context, it seems worthwhile to note that this milestone has already been exceeded.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Irizarry calculates that about 70 percent of excess deaths nationally derive from just five states: New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Massachusetts and Illinois.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The idea that official figures are undercounts is widely acknowledged. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci told a Senate health committee on Tuesday that he didn\'92t know if the real death toll was 50 percent higher than the official figures, but that \'93almost certainly it\'92s higher.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93Most frontline doctors will tell you that the numbers are grossly underreported,\'94 said Michael P. Jones, an emergency medicine physician who works at hospitals in the Bronx that were particularly hard hit. Especially in the early days, he said, many Covid-19 deaths were simply listed as some variant of \'93respiratory failure\'94 or \'93multisystem organ failure.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Dr. Alicia Skarimbas, who practices in New Jersey, said, \'93We signed so many death certificates, we would get behind and take turns doing them.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Skarimbas said that she would list Covid-19 as the cause of death when that seemed obvious, but her partners might simply list \'93respiratory failure\'94 unless there had been a positive test for the virus. Thus it was often random whether Covid-19 was listed as the cause of death.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The undercounting is a global problem, not just one in the United States. Dr. Christopher Murray of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington estimates that globally, excess deaths are about double the official Covid-19 death counts.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Excess deaths are often used to gauge mortality from an event or an epidemic. When Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico in 2017, the official death toll stood for a year at 64. But Irizarry and other scholars used a 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 variety of techniques
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  to calculate that excess deaths in the aftermath       \'a0    
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 exceeded 1,000
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , perhaps by a wide margin. As a result of the statistical work, the official death toll is now       \'a0    
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 2,975
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone .
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Covid-19 will inevitably continue to kill people in the weeks ahead. Those who die over the next week or two have already been infected, perhaps several weeks ago. Dr. Tom Frieden, a former director of the C.D.C., notes that even if one could end all new infections, thousands would still die from infections already contracted.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Given the uncertainty and the lags in data, why go through this exercise of estimating deaths? Because flawed numbers based on an undercount are already a central part of the discussion, informing policy decisions, and Trump has made them so.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 \'93We have saved thousands and thousands of lives,\'94 he 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 said
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  on May 1. \'93Hopefully, we are going to come in below that 100,000 lives lost.\'94 In that context, it seems worthwhile to note that this milestone has already been exceeded.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 We haven't addressed the sins of elections past. That's a problem for November.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 ATLANTA -- I talk with black voters every day, and what I hear keeps me up at night. Their faith in the political system is being eroded by voter suppression and the government's negligent response to the pandemic. It breaks my heart that even black women at church -- unfailing voters who rally their friends to turn out for every election -- have asked me, ''Will our votes even be counted?'' 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   These very real challenges require a whole new playbook. The problem is that Democrats have long treated black people as though all they need is a gentle nudge the week before the election. Although Donald Trump won Georgia by just 211,000 votes in 2016, some 900,000 eligible black people stayed home, a majority of them Atlanta residents. They were unconvinced that voting for the Democratic candidate would mean getting a president who represented them.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   This is a treasure trove of gettable voters who could overwhelm the political system. But Democrats have to persuade them, now more than ever, that voting will get them candidates up and down the ballot who care about things like health care expansion and ballot access. Unless Democrats address their shortcomings, I fear we are on track for another catastrophic Election Day.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Part of the problem is the mismanagement of the pandemic. Georgia's governor, Brian Kemp, defied science and logic when he started reopening the state on April 24. One model predicts the number of Covid-19 deaths will quadruple by August.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Black people, who make up one-third of the population of Georgia but represented 83 percent of coronavirus hospital patients in March and half of deaths, will continue to be disproportionately harmed. We've been screaming from mountaintops about the health care crisis in the state's rural southwest for years; the region has a dire shortage of doctors and hospitals. Yet a few majority-black counties there have some of the highest death rates in the country.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The governor refused to fully expand Medicaid, leaving nearly half a million people without coverage (36 percent of whom are black and 22 percent Latino) and $45 billion on the table over the next decade. Now he plans to slash funding for state agencies, including the one that administers Medicaid, while enrollment is projected to rise.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Republicans in Georgia and other Southern states are weaponizing the virus against black people while ramping up efforts to suppress the vote.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Another part of the problem when it comes to mobilizing black voters for November is that we haven't addressed the sins of elections past. Southwestern Georgia is also where, long before anyone listened, black people sounded the alarm that Mr. Kemp would try to steal the race for governor in 2018 from his Democratic rival, Stacey Abrams (disclosure: my organization was founded by Ms. Abrams).
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   As secretary of state overseeing his own election, Mr. Kemp served as umpire, player and scorekeeper, purging 670,000 voters from the rolls in 2017 and, weeks before the 2018 election, withholding 53,000 more registrations under a spurious ''exact match'' law (70 percent of those registrations were from black people). Mr. Kemp also oversaw the shutdown of 214 precincts. Georgia had the longest lines in the country that year and the highest rejection rates of absentee and provisional ballots.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   A consultant linked to Mr. Kemp recommended that the board of elections in majority-black Randolph County close seven of its nine polling locations. Why? The bathrooms in the polling locations lacked handrails, which the board claimed violated federal disability law.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   But the county had earlier refused to apply for money for the handrails when given the chance. It dropped the consolidation plan only after enormous attention from the news media. Such hyperlocal voter suppression has become rampant since the Supreme Court freed elections officials in Georgia and other states from having to prove to the Justice Department in advance that their voting changes would not be discriminatory.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mr. Kemp won the race by just 54,700 votes. If Jim Crow laws suppressed votes by forcing black voters to guess the number of jelly beans in a jar, Dr. James Crow, with a Ph.D. in 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone , has erected a more sophisticated suppression apparatus -- sophistication we have to match.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   But I have not seen any campaign, political party or elected official address voters' pain at having their voices silenced. I know that pain has also spread to Alabama and Mississippi, where people were looking at Ms. Abrams's candidacy as a glimpse into what was possible. They also saw the theft. And they saw the world move on as if a major crime against democracy had not been committed. That's a problem.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   When we talk to college students now, the most common refrain we hear is, ''I know my vote won't count.'' My organization registered a staggering 18,000 17- and 18-year-olds in the months after the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., in February 2018. They flooded our office with earnest messages, wanting to learn how they could set up registration drives in their schools.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   We told them voting was a way to make material improvements in their lives by electing candidates like Lucy McBath, a Georgia representative who cares about gun reform. Then they watched as they were robbed of their civic voice, without any consequences. We have to address that if we want to win in November.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Action is even more urgent because the pandemic is being used as cover for more voter suppression.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   At the national level, the Republican National Committee doubled its litigation budget to file even more lawsuits to limit vote by mail access. Republicans aim to recruit up to 50,000 volunteers in 15 key states to monitor polling places and intimidate voters. Those efforts are aided by Donald Trump, who appointed a top Republican fund-raiser to serve as postmaster general, and is withholding a $10 billion loan from the Post Office, which desperately needs the money.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Georgia may be the center of all this. The state has created an absentee ballot ''fraud'' task force made up of mostly prosecutors and mostly Republicans to hinder voting by mail. ''If a county official says my signature doesn't match,'' Cathy Cox, a Democrat who is a former secretary of state for Georgia, asked a reporter, ''is this task force going to show up with guns and badges at my office or my home?''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Our office continues to receive a troubling number of inquiries about whether absentee ballots will even be counted. The question is common, and for good reason. We asked the 159 counties in Georgia where they'll place drop boxes for those who want to avoid human contact during the pandemic. Only 78 provided locations and more than one-quarter won't have drop boxes.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   These are monumental challenges that require a monumental response. We need the courage to act on a scale we've never seen before.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   If Democrats invest in an enormous marketing and organizing campaign that persuades black people and young people to participate in our democracy, we will win. That campaign should answer uncomfortable questions about what happened in Georgia in 2018 and explain how this year will be different. Through millions of personal conversations, organizers can connect the dots between who makes decisions that puts their lives at risk and who can make things better. That's how we can show young people grieving the killing of Ahmaud Arbery in South Georgia that voting is a way to create real change by electing new sheriffs and prosecutors.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Campaigns never balk at investing significant resources to court moderate white men. But when all the data is laid out about black people, why does the political industry hesitate? Black people have long been the most loyal supporters of the Democratic Party -- indeed, no other major voting bloc is as loyal to a political party as black people.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Every 10 new black voters nets eight Democratic votes, but the party gets only two net votes for every 10 new white, college-educated female voters. Democrats have to stop treating black people as deserving of only mailers after Labor Day and instead see them as the core of the multiracial coalition.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   We have to address voter suppression head on, identifying the hurdles and offering solutions now, not in October. My organization is suing Georgia over its practice of throwing out absentee ballots postmarked by Election Day but received after 7 p.m. that night. And for imposing a poll tax by sending absentee ballot applications to voters without prepaid returnable envelopes. This creates obstacles for people unwilling to go out during a pandemic to buy stamps or vote in person.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Vote-by-mail is not a panacea. While it is the safest option we have and it provides a paper trail, some states are using it in a way that creates hurdles.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   My organization is building mobile video games to educate new and infrequent voters. Bad actors are online, sowing doubt about basic facts to undermine faith in the democratic process. That's why we are launching programs to monitor social media and provide media literacy that will compete for black voters's hearts, minds, attention and votes. We also need foundations, state and federal governments and the Democrats to prevent and neutralize disinformation campaigns. Part of that means investing in trusted messengers to spread competing messages with good information, in addition to inspirational candidates who can alleviate voters' concerns.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The next federal coronavirus legislation package must include $3.6 billion so states can expand their vote-by-mail initiatives and make voting easier. In addition, states should mount public education campaigns that include infographics and videos in multiple languages about how to cast ballots during the pandemic. In Georgia, the secretary of state must urge elections officials and lawmakers to increase funding and hire and train more staff members to deal with the increase in absentee ballots.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   A vibrant, robust democracy is our greatest weapon against authoritarian rule. And black people have been at the vanguard of fighting for that democracy. This year, more than ever, we need overwhelming participation in our elections to neutralize voter suppression and halt the rise of despotic, unaccountable leaders. Our liberty and our lives are at stake.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Xin Yin was excited to be visiting his parents in the Shandong Province of China last December. Yin, a researcher in the Immunity and Pathogenesis Program at the Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute in California, hadn\'92t been home in five years. So much had changed since then \'97 a new high-speed rail station now connected his hometown with Beijing, for example. On Jan. 1, Yin was at the Beijing station, headed back to Shandong after seeing friends, when someone texted him about an unusual cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan. Pneumonia, an infection of the lungs, is typically caused by the flu or another virus. Yin, whose Ph.D. is in molecular virology, was intrigued. He texted a friend who lives in Wuhan, as well as several others who work in hospitals, to see if they had heard anything about the cluster. It wasn\'92t the flu, they told him.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 On Jan. 7, he got a message saying that the virus appeared to be related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 coronavirus
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , a highly contagious pathogen first identified in 2003 and responsible for the SARS outbreak that sickened some 8,000 people worldwide and killed nearly 800 of them. \'93At that moment, I am shocked,\'94 Yin says. He emailed his boss, Sumit Chanda, the director of the program, and told him he thought the situation in Wuhan might be graver than was currently being reported.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Chanda\'92s lab studies respiratory and other viruses, including Influenza A, in order to design drugs that combat them. This process can take a decade or more to succeed (or fail definitively) and can cost hundreds of millions of dollars. But his lab also tests already existing drugs to see if they can be repurposed against pathogens \'97 the dengue virus, say \'97 for which there are no effective vaccines or treatments. A drug that has already been tested for safety can proceed to human clinical trials for new uses in weeks or months, rather than years. Alarmed by the potential of the novel coronavirus to set off a pandemic, and knowing that a vaccine could take years to develop, Chanda decided \'93to go all in,\'94 as he puts it, and use his lab to look for a drug that could be deployed against it quickly.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Finding a way to prevent or treat Covid-19 has since become the overwhelming focus in medical-research facilities around the world. Keeping track of the number of projects and their progress is all but impossible: Reportedly, some 90 projects had pursued vaccines, and a handful are proceeding to clinical trials. At the same time, scientists are searching for intermediate treatment options that could reduce the numbers of people becoming critically ill and dying. This effort includes repurposing existing drugs. By mid-April, the Food and Drug Administration website had listed 72 active Covid drug trials and 211 programs in planning stages; 950 drug-development proposals or inquiries had been submitted to the agency. So far, only one drug, remdesivir, has been shown in a major, randomized control trial to lessen the recovery time of Covid patients, according to preliminary results.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 There is no standard way of arriving at drugs to test. The choice of remdesivir was based on established understandings of how both it and coronaviruses are known to work. Some groups are using computer software to model how the virus interacts with human cells and to search for compounds that might inhibit that action. But because there is still much that researchers don\'92t know about how the virus behaves, actually testing thousands of drugs simultaneously can point to potential therapies that logic couldn\'92t predict. \'91\'91It\'92s a real nonbiased experiment,\'92\'92 says Ajay Nirula, vice president for immunology at Lilly Research Laboratories, a drug-development arm of the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly. \'93You get unexpected insights here, and it\'92s probably going to teach us something about the viral biology and generate some hypotheses.\'94 Indeed, because researchers have studied the mechanisms by which known drugs interact with cells, those that fail in screenings can potentially reveal just as much about how the virus behaves as those that succeed, says Matthew Hall, a scientist at the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, which is also screening drugs against the coronavirus.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 On April 17, Chanda, Yin and 29 co-authors from institutions around the world published a paper detailing their findings on the preprint server bioRxiv.org. (The paper is currently being peer-reviewed for publication in a journal.) They tested 12,000 drugs and identified 30 that appear to stop the virus from destroying human cells. Of those, four have already been clinically tested for other uses, including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn\'92s disease, osteoporosis and cancer, and they seem to neutralize the virus in doses that people are likely to tolerate.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 What makes the work done by Chanda and his colleagues noteworthy is the number of drugs they assessed and the speed with which that happened. It was, Nirula says, \'93a technological tour de force.\'94 In the U.S., Hall estimates, only a few dozen labs have the capability of testing so many compounds at once, a process called high-throughput screening. Yet how Chanda\'92s lab went from a text message on a train platform to a handful of strong drug candidates in four months required as much cooperation as it did machinery. The collaborations they formed, spanning multiple unrelated institutions, are unusual in the competitive world of drug development. \'93These networks we\'92ve set up are all ad hoc, calling up a friend of a friend and putting it together,\'94 Chanda says. \'93My hope is that we take the infrastructure we\'92ve built in an ad hoc way and reinforce it so that it will be there for the next time. There will be a next time.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In January, after hearing from Yin in China, Chanda urged him to return as soon as possible. Yin arrived back in California on Jan. 21. Two days later, Wuhan went into lockdown. By then, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had obtained a sample of the virus from what was then the first known case in the U.S., outside Seattle, but it was unclear when researchers would be able to get samples. It would be quicker, Chanda thought, to partner with a Chinese lab that already had the pathogen but was unable to perform high-throughput screening; such a lab wouldn\'92t be able to send him a viral sample, but maybe a scientist from his lab could go there. He soon got word that a team at the University of Hong Kong led by Yuen Kwok-yung, the microbiologist whose work was instrumental in identifying the SARS coronavirus in 2003, had cultured the novel coronavirus and was willing to collaborate.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 On Jan. 24, Chanda reached out to Arnab Chatterjee, vice president for medicinal chemistry at Calibr at Scripps Research. The two had met nearly 18 years earlier, when both were scientists at the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation. The institute was established in 1999 and soon began to study, among other things, the interaction of drug molecules with the tens of thousands of genes in the human genome, whose sequencing was close to completion. Until then, scientists had mostly looked at one gene at a time; the institute\'92s founding director, Peter Schultz, a chemist and entrepreneur, was one of the first to utilize the sort of robotics used in automotive-assembly lines to look at thousands of genes at once. (He got the idea from a former college roommate who was an engineer at the car company Saturn.) Eventually, Schultz left Novartis, and in 2012 he founded Calibr, where Chatterjee joined him. They planned to partner with commercial enterprises to find existing drugs that could treat rare or neglected diseases for which pharmaceutical companies have little financial incentive to develop therapies.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The concept showed promise early: A leprosy drug, clofazimine, appears to be effective against a parasite that is a leading cause of infant death from diarrhea worldwide; an arthritis drug, auranofin, looks as though it might be a possible tuberculosis treatment. But only about half of the molecules that have safety records for use in people were commercially available to screen. In 2015, Schultz pitched the idea of compiling a complete collection to the Gates Foundation, which gave Calibr $20 million. By 2018, it had bought 7,000 compounds and hired 500 chemists, who spent 18 months synthesizing 5,000 more compounds. The ReFrame library, as it is called, stores 20 milligrams of each compound, in powder form, in vials stacked in filing cabinets and freezers. It is the largest drug-repurposing library in the world and is available free to all academic and nonprofit labs, like Sanford Burnham Prebys, so long as they make any resulting data publicly available.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Chanda told Chatterjee he wanted to send all 12,000 compounds to Hong Kong, along with high-throughput screening equipment. A lab member named Laura Riva had planned to accompany the shipment and run the screening. ReFrame keeps 1 milligram of each of its compounds dissolved in a solvent on a \'93mother plate,\'94 a piece of plastic not much larger than an eight-track cassette, with 384 wells sunk into it. When someone wants the library, an acoustic dispenser, roughly the size of a coffee maker, uses sound waves to transfer nanoliters of each compound to a \'93daughter plate.\'94 The entire library, about 40 plates\'92 worth, can fit inside a briefcase. While the plates were prepared, Riva, who is from Bergamo, Italy, began applying for a visa. On Jan. 31, however, President Trump announced a ban on most non-U.S. citizens arriving from China, meaning Riva almost certainly wouldn\'92t be able to return. The only solution, she and Chanda decided, was to ship the equipment and the library to Hong Kong and have Riva talk the scientists there through the setup over her iPhone.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In preparation, Riva set up a dispenser at Sanford Burnham Prebys, documenting each step of the process with photos and video. Paul De Jesus, a senior lab manager, bubble-wrapped another, along with extra plates, adapters and power converters, and shipped it to Hong Kong. When it was accidentally sent to mainland China, initiating a customs delay, De Jesus realized that the same thing could happen to the library, which had to stay frozen. So he found a company called World Courier that promised to refill the package with dry ice every few days.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 For the next month, Riva watched over WeChat as Shuofeng Yuan, a scientist at the Hong Kong lab, and his colleagues unpacked the boxes and set up the dispenser. Because they could not take phones into the biosafety chamber with the virus, they practiced each step before entering so they could troubleshoot with Riva. Yuan had a 3-month-old daughter at home whom he was barely seeing. Riva was worried about her parents in Bergamo, which was becoming the center of the crisis in Italy. There was no time to share personal stories, but Riva felt a kinship with Yuan. \'93They were as restless as our side,\'94 she says. \'93OK, let\'92s keep moving. We can do it.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 After several days of practice, Yuan and colleagues set up the dispenser in the isolation chamber and began the screening. They combined monkey cells with the virus and each of the library\'92s 12,000 drugs (along with drugs from another smaller library); the dispenser apportioned the mixes to the drug wells in a matter of minutes. After three days, they added another substance, called a reagent, that would glow when it detected ATP, an organic compound that provides energy to living cells. If the virus had killed the monkey cells, no ATP would be present. If it hadn\'92t, \'93there will be a luminance,\'94 Yuan says. \'93A signal to tell us whether the cell is happy or not.\'94 The screening, run twice, identified about 300 compounds that seemed to have kept the cells alive.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 By mid-March, the 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 C.D.C.
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  was sending coronavirus samples to U.S. labs. On March 9, around 10 a.m., Laura Martin-Sancho, a scientist in Chanda\'92s lab, got a call from the receiving department: It had a hazardous package for them. Martin-Sancho, who has worked in biosafety labs with influenza viruses, would be the one to open the box and replicate the virus so they would have enough of it to test. A safety team deposited the box in the biosafety lab anteroom. Once Martin-Sancho was fully dressed in protective gear, she took the box inside the biosafety chamber. Inside was a second box, which she placed in a sterile cabinet. Inside that box was a metallic tube. Inside the tube was another tube \'97 inside of which was a vial that contained, as she puts it, \'93a few drops of the virus that everyone is fearing.\'94 Martin-Sancho adds, \'93I remember Laura Riva looking at me like, If you cannot do it, nobody can.\'94
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Using very small amounts from the vial, Martin-Sancho tested 18 ways of cultivating the virus, staying in the chamber as long as she could manage. On the afternoon of March 13, she sent an email to Chanda, Riva and Yin: \'93We do have cytopathic effect!!!\'94 The virus was multiplying, in other words. Soon Martin-Sancho was testing the 300 compounds identified by the Hong Kong group on infected human cells, while Riva tried to replicate the group\'92s results in monkey cells. As a check, they used different reagents to detect the virus, which had been sent by Adolfo Garcia-Sastre, director of the Global Health and Emerging Pathogens Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. Garcia-Sastre and colleagues had developed the reagents for the original SARS virus. When that outbreak ended, instead of throwing them away, he stored them in a freezer; now, nearly two decades later, they proved effective at revealing the presence of the novel coronavirus.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 On March 19, California\'92s governor, Gavin Newsom, ordered residents to stay at home. Riva, Martin-Sancho, Chanda and Yin were deemed essential workers and continued to report to the lab. From home, Paul De Jesus worked with vendors to keep Riva and Martin-Sancho supplied with the protective gear that was running short nationwide. In Bergamo, Riva\'92s father fell ill with Covid-19; hospitals there were overflowing, and doctors were being forced to decide whom to turn away. Martin-Sancho tried to take a 15-minute walk every day to call her mother, who lives in Valladolid, Spain, and was under strict lockdown; she and the rest of her family wrote to her 99-year-old grandmother, who is in a nursing home there and is hard of hearing, explaining why they couldn\'92t visit her. Martin-Sancho\'92s niece sent her pictures of the virus, which she drew as a Pac-Man ghost with eyelashes. Yin, too, called his parents daily. \'93Just stay at home,\'94 he told them. \'93Clean your hands. Clean everything.\'94 The three have logged long hours trying to determine not only which compounds work against the virus but also at what doses and in which combinations they are most effective. \'93We support each other,\'94 Yin told me in early April. He added, \'93We are so tired.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Their preprint, the largest screening of drugs against the virus to have publicly produced results to date, has sparked collaborations with large pharmaceutical companies like Eli Lilly, as well as academic and government labs. \'93They\'92ve gotten really promising hits,\'94 says Micholas Dean Smith, a biophysicist at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, who has used computer modeling to search for potential Covid drugs. When Eytan Ruppin, chief of the Cancer 
\f0\i\b \ul Data Science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Laboratory at the National Institutes of Health\'92s Center for Cancer Research, saw the preprint, he turned the computer network his lab uses toward analyzing some of the drugs that did best in the screening to predict which are likely to succeed in actual patients and in what combinations. At Kansas State University, Juergen Richt, a professor of veterinary science, has begun testing several top targets on animals. The maker of the drug that performed best in the screening, AI Therapeutics, was already investigating it for use against the virus. The compound, apilimod, was initially being developed as an anti-inflammatory. By inhibiting a particular enzyme, it may disable basic cellular processes that the virus uses to access the cell and replicate. The company thinks it may work prophylactically to prevent infection.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It hopes to begin F.D.A.-approved clinical trials in the next few months, says Murat Gunel, a scientific adviser at the company and chair of the neurosurgery department at the Yale School of Medicine; he believes results from Chanda\'92s study and others could strengthen its application. AI will soon have about 200,000 pills available and is processing the materials needed to make five million more. \'93If it\'92s effective, we won\'92t have to wait any time, because the pills are ready,\'94 Gunel says. \'93If the clinical trials fail, we will have a lot of pills.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Indeed, there\'92s no guarantee that any of those drugs will succeed in patients. \'93A lot of these screens will throw up a lot of false positives, but they\'92re likely to be completely ineffective,\'94 says Munir Pirmohamed, the director of the MRC Center for Drug Safety Science at the University of Liverpool. And because viruses mutate, shape-shifting to evade a particular drug, it might ultimately be a cocktail of several drugs, as is used to treat H.I.V., that emerges as the eventual treatment.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Calibr says that some 20 other groups are now screening the ReFrame library. Like skydivers leaping from a plane, Chanda says, the slightest difference in how the screenings are set up will mean landing in different places. \'93So it\'92s really important that more people do this.\'94 If his lab\'92s initial screening yields one drug ready for patients by October \'97 when he and others anticipate that there may be a second wave of infections \'97 \'93that would be a resounding success.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It\'92s still unclear how the pandemic will affect other scientific pursuits. Many labs have been forced to shut down or redirect their focus, away from their usual subjects and toward Covid-related research. On the other hand, that \'93team science\'94 approach could also, Pirmohamed thinks, enable researchers to tackle longstanding global health issues like cancer and heart disease more efficiently. \'93When we come out the other side,\'94 he says, \'93I hope that collaboration continues.\'94

\cf0 \'91I have no regrets about calling out this danger,\'92 de Blasio said of a crowded Hasidic funeral.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Mayor Bill de Blasio 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 lashed out at Hasidic residents of
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  Brooklyn\'92s Williamsburg neighborhood late Tuesday after personally overseeing the police\'92s dispersal of a crowd that had gathered for the funeral of a rabbi who died of the coronavirus.\
Mr. de Blasio 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 warned
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  \'93the Jewish community, and all communities\'94 on Twitter that violations of social-distancing rules could lead to summonses or arrest. Dermot F. Shea, the police commissioner, said 12 summonses had been issued, including four for refusal to disperse.\
At his briefing on Wednesday, the 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 mayor defended his handling of the funeral
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  and his use of the phrase \'93Jewish community\'94 when he criticized the mourners.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \'93Members of the Jewish community were putting each other in danger,\'94 he said. \'93They were putting our police officers in danger.\'94 \
Mr. de Blasio said the funeral for Rabbi Chaim Mertz was \'93by far the largest gathering in any community of New York City of any kind that I had heard of or seen directly or on video since the beginning of this crisis, and it\'92s just not allowable.\'94\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 New York\'92s ultra-Orthodox Hasidic neighborhoods 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 have been hit especially hard by the virus
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , and Hasidic residents\'92 tendency to congregate in groups has been held partly responsible.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Jacob Mertz, a spokesman for the rabbi\'92s synagogue, Kahal Tolath Yakov, said in a statement that it had tried to organize the funeral to stay within social-distancing guidelines, but that \'93unfortunately, this didn\'92t pan out, and N.Y.P.D. had to disperse the crowds.\'94\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Jewish leaders and groups reacted with outrage to Mr. de Blasio\'92s remarks about the funeral, which took place on the same day as a 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 military flyover that drew crowds
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  to parks and sidewalks.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 On Wednesday, Mr. de Blasio offered a limited apology, but he said he would not tolerate violations of social-distancing guidelines.\
\'93If in my emotion I said something that in any way was hurtful, I\'92m sorry about that, that was not my intention,\'94 he said. \'93But I also want to be clear, I have no regrets about calling out this danger and saying I want to deal with it very, very aggressively.\'94\
Transit officials announced a plan to address the issue of homeless people on subway.\
After days of public squabbling over the problem of homeless people taking shelter on New York City\'92s subway during the pandemic, transit officials announced new rules meant to address the issue on Wednesday.\
Riders will not be allowed to remain in a station for more than an hour, and large wheeled carts, like shopping or grocery carts, have been banned from the system, officials said.\
As long as the public health emergency continues, riders will also not be allowed to remain on a train or platform after an announcement that a train is being taken out of service. \
\'93I want to be clear the status quo has been completely unacceptable,\'94 said Sarah Feinberg, the interim president of New York City Transit, which operates the subway and buses. \'93It\'92s my job to make sure everyone who rides our system feels safe and secure and that our work force feels safe and secure.\'94\
With the subway carrying less than 10 percent of its usual riders and running fewer trains, the number of homeless people who are effectively living on the subway has come into sharper focus in the past two months.\
Pictures of homeless people on the subway have circulated on social media and in the media, stoking fears about hygiene and safety on the trains in the midst of the pandemic.\
Mr. Cuomo, at his daily briefing on Tuesday, held up one such photo, on the cover of The Daily News, and said it was \'93disgusting\'94 and \'93disrespectful\'94 to essential workers.\
City officials and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the state agency that oversees the transit system, have sparred this week over how to address the issue.\
On Monday, Mr. de Blasio asked the authority to close 10 end-of-line subway terminals every night so the trains could be cleaned and city workers could connect homeless riders with social services.\
Authority officials said that closing all 10 stations every night would limit essential workers\'92 access to the system, but they agreed to take some trains out of service and to close certain platforms for cleaning during late-night hours.\
They have also said the city should do more to address the issue of homelessness on the subway, even after the pandemic. \
\'93It should not have taken a global pandemic for the city to do a job the M.T.A. has called on it to do for years,\'94 said Abbey Collins, an authority spokeswoman.\
Murphy announced 329 deaths and said New Jersey parks would reopen on Saturday.\
The three-week closing of New Jersey\'92s state and county parks is coming to an end.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Gov. Philip D. Murphy, who had faced criticism since 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 closing the parks
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  on April 7, said they would reopen at dawn on Saturday. Golf courses, closed since mid-March, may also reopen.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 But Mr. Murphy reported that 329 more people had died of the virus in New Jersey, marking the first time the one-day death toll in the state virtually equaled that in New York, where 330 deaths were reported. (New Jersey reported more deaths than New York on Tuesday, but Mr. Murphy said the figure included a backlog of several days.) \
The death toll is particularly striking given that New Jersey has less than half the population of New York.\
Mr. Murphy said the decision on parks and golf courses, which will reopen on Saturday at sunrise, was not influenced \'93one little bit\'94 by criticism.\
\'93We made this call based on 
\f0\i\b \ul data, science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone , facts and frankly mental health,\'94 he said.\
State parks in New York have remained open, while counties have been able to make their own decisions. Officials in Rockland County, which borders New Jersey, said that parks there would reopen on Friday.\
Mr. Murphy said reductions in hospitalizations, the decreasing rate of positive tests and the concern that people needed a physical outlet to ease the stress of isolation were major factors in the decision to reopen the parks.\
He asked that people wear face masks while in parks and golf courses.\
The total number of deaths in New Jersey stands at 6,770. \
Mr. Murphy, who regularly names those who have died, cited Latasha Andrews, a 33-year-old civilian staff security guard for the State Police who died of the virus after losing her mother and grandfather to it. \
Daily deaths in New York held steady at 330.\
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo reported on Wednesday that 330 more people had died of the coronavirus in New York.\
The one-day death toll was less than half of those the state was recording earlier in April, when there were nearly 800 virus-related deaths a day. But the fatality figures have remained stubbornly steady this week, with 337 deaths reported on Monday and 335 reported on Tuesday. \
Mr. Cuomo also said the number of virus patients newly admitted to the hospital had risen slightly for the first time in 12 days. \'93That is not good news,\'94 he said.\
Other developments from the governor\'92s briefing:\

\ls91\ilvl0\cf0 \'95	Amid a continuing debate over homeless people sleeping on subway trains, Mr. Cuomo said he was ordering the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, a state agency that he effectively controls, to come up with a plan by Thursday spelling out \'93how do we disinfect every train every night, period.\'94\
\pard\tx760\pardeftab720\li760\fi-400\ri0\sl260\sb120\qj\partightenfactor0
\ls92\ilvl0\cf0 \'95	He said he would issue an order allowing elective surgeries to resume in 35 of the state\'92s 62 counties. New York City and the five downstate counties closest to the city will not be covered by the order. \
\pard\tx760\pardeftab720\li760\fi-400\ri0\sl260\sb120\qj\partightenfactor0
\ls93\ilvl0\cf0 \'95	New York State is well on the way to its goal of doubling testing capacity to 40,000 tests a day from the 20,000 it had been doing as of last week. The state is now testing 30,000 people a day for the virus, more than most countries, Mr. Cuomo said.\
\pard\tx760\pardeftab720\li760\fi-400\ri0\sl260\sb120\qj\partightenfactor0
\ls94\ilvl0\cf0 \'95	The governor displayed a collage made of masks that he said had been sent to New York from around the United States. On Twitter, several people questioned the governor for using the masks is a political display, rather than distributing them to people who could use them. (The governor\'92s office said the masks would be distributed.)\
\pard\tx760\pardeftab720\li760\fi-400\ri0\sl260\sb120\qj\partightenfactor0
\ls95\ilvl0\cf0 \'95	Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, continued to criticize Republican politicians, the latest being Senator Rick Scott of Florida, who say New York and other states hit hard by the virus are trying to exploit it for federal funding to be used to offset other bad decisions.\'93It\'92s just theater, it\'92s just smoke and mirrors to avoid the American people seeing the reality, which is whose pocket they want to put money in,\'94 the governor said, meaning large corporations.\

\cf0 City officials keep open the possibility of beach access this summer.\
With the weather warming and New Yorkers itching to spend more time outdoors, top city officials have indicated that they are considering whether, and how, public beaches might open at some point this summer. \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 In an interview with 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 1010 WINS radio on Tuesday
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker, said lawmakers would look into how to provide beach access as the city gradually reopens.\

\cf0 \'93Is there a strategic way?\'94 he asked. \'93Could you count the number of people before they enter and have some strict guidelines? Those are going to be the nuanced conversations that need to be had.\'94\

\cf0 The city\'92s 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 playgrounds
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  are already closed, and officials have said municipal pools 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 will not open this summer
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone . \
Mr. de Blasio was asked about the city\'92s plan for the beaches in an interview on Monday 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 on NY1
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone . He noted that while swimming is not allowed before the Memorial Day weekend, the beaches are technically open public space.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0  \'93If we make a lot of progress, there is a possibility of doing more with the beaches later on in the summer,\'94 he said. \
\'93I\'92m not ruling that out because we\'92ve made some really good progress in the last few weeks,\'94 he added.\
The city is bringing its marriage license process online.\
Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Johnson said on Wednesday that the city would bring its marriage licensing process online. The moves followed one by Mr. Cuomo on April 18 to waive a law that requires New Yorkers to get marriage licenses in person. \
The governor\'92s order also allowed marriage ceremonies to take place remotely, ensuring that couples who obtained licenses could get married. \
The city is calling the effort \'93Project Cupid.\'94\
\'93We won\'92t let a pandemic get in the way of true love,\'94 the mayor said in a statement in which he urged New Yorkers getting married to imagine their city \'93throwing rice from afar.\'94\
At his daily briefing, the mayor said that marriage licenses would be available online late next week.\
The new system will incorporate videoconferencing technology and will allow appointments with the City Clerk to be made remotely, necessary documents to be submitted online and any fees to be paid electronically as well. \
New York\'92s attorney general threatened Trump with legal action over \'91sanctuary city\'92 comments.\
After President Trump suggested Tuesday that decisions on whether to provide federal funding to states might be affected by their cities\'92 treatment of immigrants, New York\'92s attorney general, Letitia James, said that she was \'93ready to take legal action\'94 against the president.\
Asked by a reporter about funding for states hit hard by the coronavirus, Mr. Trump said that such aid might hinge on their immigration policy.\
\'93We\'92d have to talk about things like sanctuary cities,\'94 he said, adding, \'93I think it\'92s one of the problems that the states have. I don\'92t even think they know they have a problem, but they have a big problem with it \'97 the sanctuary city situation.\'94\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Sanctuary cities, in which local law enforcement declines to cooperate with federal immigration authorities, 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 have long been an irritant for Mr. Trump
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone . But it was not clear whether the president intended to follow up on his comment.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Tuesday evening, Ms. James issued a statement threatening legal action. \
\'93New York is proud of its status as a sanctuary state that welcomes and will fight to protect its immigrant residents \'97 many of whom are fighting on the front lines to battle the coronavirus,\'94 the statement said.\
The city calls in military trauma experts to address \'91combat stress\'92 in front-line workers.\
Mr. de Blasio and the first lady, Chirlane McCray, on Wednesday announced a partnership with the Defense Department through which the military would train 1,000 public-hospital staff members to provide care for front-line medical workers who need mental health support.\
Ms. McCray called the effort a \'93critical new piece of what we are doing for all of our essential front-line workers in New York City.\'94\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Acknowledging the sacrifices made by health care workers, Ms. McCray also asked for a moment of silence to remember

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The governor outlined a plan to restart the economy, beginning with manufacturing and construction, and suggested professional sports could resume without fans.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 ALBANY, N.Y. \'97 With promising indications that the coronavirus contagion has passed its peak, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York laid out a broad outline on Sunday for a gradual restart of the state that would allow some \'93low-risk\'94 businesses upstate to reopen as soon as mid-May.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The governor\'92s announcement, coming as the state recorded its lowest death daily toll in nearly a month, was filled with caveats, but nonetheless offered the clearest outline yet for recovery in New York, the national center of the outbreak, with nearly 17,000 dead.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 That human devastation has largely been confined thus far to New York City and its sprawling suburbs. And under Mr. Cuomo\'92s plan, upstate regions would move forward with reopening long before downstate, with an emphasis on manufacturing and construction, industries in which telecommuting and working from home are impossible.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 During his daily briefing in the State Capitol in Albany, Mr. Cuomo said such changes could occur shortly after May 15, when a statewide stay-at-home order \'97 known as New York State On Pause \'97 is scheduled to lapse, though the governor has indicated that many restrictions on businesses and residents\'92 activities could be continued for weeks, if not months.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 He did not suggest any loosening of restrictions on New York City in the near future.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Still, the governor\'92s remarks offered a hint of a return to normalcy for some state residents, following weeks of heartbreaking news and amid a still-cascading economic disaster.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93The numbers are on the decline: Everything we have done is working,\'94 Mr. Cuomo said, adding that while caution was still needed, \'93There\'92s no doubt that we\'92ve gone at this point through the worst. And as long as we act prudently going forward, the worst should be over.\'94
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The governor\'92s cautious embrace of a phased reopening comes even as other states \'97 largely led by Republican governors \'97 have 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 been more aggressive about such plans
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone .
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f4\i\fs20 \cf2 \ul \ulc2 In Georgia
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , close-contact retail businesses like barbers and tattoo parlors were allowed to open on Friday. Areas where large numbers of people congregate, such as movie theaters, were expected to accept customers on Monday, though mayors of large cities like Atlanta and 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Augusta have resisted
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  Gov. Brian Kemp\'92s call for reopening.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Mr. Cuomo, a third-term Democrat, said that he was closely monitoring hospitalization, infection and recovery rates in the city and regionally, with an eye toward the federal guidelines 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 released by the White House
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  10 days ago. Under those, states were advised that they could move into limited reopening if they satisfied a series of criteria, including two weeks of sustained downward trends in documented cases of Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, and an easing of stress on the hospital system.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 On Sunday evening, Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey said that he too would begin to lay out a vision for reopening his state, which has also lost thousands of lives to the coronavirus. \'93The road back will be driven by 
\f0\i\b \ul data, science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  and common sense,\'94 Mr. Murphy said 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 in a tweet
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone .
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 In New York, the daily count of new cases statewide has generally been trending downward, though the numbers have sometimes varied significantly from day to day and they rose toward the end of last week. Another metric laid out by the White House is the percentage of tests that are positive; by that metric, New York has been on a downward trajectory.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In his remarks, Mr. Cuomo made clear that the road to reopening was cratered with potential hazards, specifically saying there should be no events or attractions that would draw people from more infected regions to less infected areas, such as Central New York or the Adirondacks, two areas he suggested were places where restrictions could soon be eased.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93It\'92s possible that you open something in Syracuse or you open something in the North Country, where you now see license plates coming in from Connecticut, New Jersey, people from downstate, all coming to that area, because they\'92ve been locked down and they\'92re looking for an activity,\'94 he said. \'93So that\'92s something that we have to pay attention to.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 At the same time, Mr. Cuomo pleaded with local officials \'97 particularly in the New York City region \'97 to consider how to provide for summer activities for residents, including children. New York\'92s mayor, Bill de Blasio, has already said that the city\'92s public swimming pools will not open this summer, even as its playgrounds remain shut for the time being.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93You can\'92t tell people in a dense urban environment all through the summer months, \'91We don\'92t have anything for you to do,\'92\'94 Mr. Cuomo said, adding, \'93There\'92s a sanity equation here.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Earlier on Sunday, Mr. de Blasio had struck a similar chord while announcing a series of advisory groups to help imagine New York City\'92s future, with an emphasis on a rebuild that \'93confronts deep inequities\'94 in low-income and minority communities, a theme Mr. Cuomo also touched on.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93We\'92re going to come back stronger and fairer,\'94 the mayor said, promising to \'93learn the powerful lessons of this horrible tragedy.\'94 He added: \'93We\'92re not going to allow the disparities that we\'92ve seen to exist in the future.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 While large gatherings seem unlikely to occur anywhere in New York anytime soon, the governor also floated the concept that professional sports leagues could play some games without crowds, saying he had discussed the idea with several team owners so people had something to watch on television.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In laying out scenarios for a broader reopening of other businesses, Mr. Cuomo suggested that data would be evaluated in two-week increments, and that companies wanting to restart work would be individually evaluated to determine \'93how essential a service does that business provide and how risky is that business.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 He also laid a heavy onus on businesses to develop their own plans for reopening, including outfitting employees with personal protective equipment, enforcing social distancing between employees and customers and instituting testing in the workplace.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93They have to think about how they are going to reopen with this quote-unquote new normal,\'94 Mr. Cuomo said, adding, \'93It\'92s very much going to be up to businesses.\'94
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The governor cautioned again and again that the state was a long way from a full recovery, warning against a possible second-wave of the virus and noting on Sunday that 367 people had been killed by the virus in the last 24 hours, bringing the death toll to 16,966 people in the state. And that number does not include 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 some 5,200 probable deaths
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  that New York City health officials have been tallying.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Indeed, while Mr. Cuomo\'92s comments offered hope for some upstate regions, the outlook for the New York City area seemed much more perilous, with countless calculations and safeguards being considered. Retail, tourism and hospitality industries \'97 the bedrock of the city\'92s economy \'97 would be difficult to restart quickly and without great care, the governor said, as would transportation and schools, which he has said he wants coordinated with neighboring New Jersey and Connecticut.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Heather C. Briccetti, the president of the Business Council of New York State, praised Sunday\'92s decision, and concurred with Mr. Cuomo that entertainment and retail would be more complicated to reopen, because of the tendency of those sectors to draw crowds. \'93That\'92s not going to happen with construction and manufacturing,\'94 she said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 That sentiment was echoed by Gary LaBarbera, the president of the 100,000-member Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York. \'93It makes perfect sense for the construction industry to be at the front end of the remobilization of the work force,\'94 he said in a statement.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 While the news was largely positive on Sunday \'97 with marked decreases in hospitalizations and other critical indicators of the crisis \'97 Mr. Cuomo said that such progress could be lost in \'93a matter of days if we\'92re not careful.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93Anybody who sits up here and says, \'91Well I\'92m going to tell you what is going happen a month down the road,\'92\'94 he said, \'93I wouldn\'92t believe that person.\'94

\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 ALBANY, N.Y. -- With promising indications that the coronavirus contagion has passed its peak, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York laid out a broad outline on Sunday for a gradual restart of the state that would allow some ''low-risk'' businesses upstate to reopen as soon as mid-May.

\f2\fs20   The governor cautioned again and again that the state was a long way from a full recovery, warning against a possible second-wave of the virus and noting on Sunday that 367 people had been killed by the virus in the last 24 hours, bringing the death toll to 16,966 people in the state. And that number does not include some 5,200 probable deaths that New York City health officials have been tallying.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Indeed, while Mr. Cuomo's comments offered hope for some upstate regions, the outlook for the New York City area seemed much more perilous, with countless calculations and safeguards being considered. Retail, tourism and hospitality industries -- the bedrock of the city's economy -- would be difficult to restart quickly and without great care, the governor said, as would transportation and schools, which he has said he wants coordinated with neighboring New Jersey and Connecticut.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Heather C. Briccetti, the president of the Business Council of New York State, praised Sunday's decision, and concurred with Mr. Cuomo that entertainment and retail would be more complicated to reopen, because of the tendency of those sectors to draw crowds. ''That's not going to happen with construction and manufacturing,'' she said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   That sentiment was echoed by Gary LaBarbera, the president of the 100,000-member Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York. ''It makes perfect sense for the construction industry to be at the front end of the remobilization of the work force,'' he said in a statement.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   While the news was largely positive on Sunday -- with marked decreases in hospitalizations and other critical indicators of the crisis -- Mr. Cuomo said that such progress could be lost in ''a matter of days if we're not careful.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Anybody who sits up here and says, 'Well I'm going to tell you what is going happen a month down the road,''' he said, ''I wouldn't believe that person.''

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Income-share agreements, promoted by Betsy DeVos and Silicon Valley, may wind up merely shifting the payment burden from some students to others.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Q: When is a student loan not a student loan? 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   A: When it's an ''income-share agreement,'' a new financial instrument being promoted by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   With total outstanding student loan balances at $1.6 trillion and rising, politicians are looking for solutions. Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have proposed forgiving much or all existing debt while making public colleges and universities tuition-free. President Trump is said to be searching for his own loan plan.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   This month at a national conference of college financial aid administrators, the Department of Education proposed an alternative: income-share agreements, a private-sector financial product that is increasingly popular among education start-ups in Silicon Valley.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The vast majority of regular student loans are issued by the federal government. After graduating, students are obligated to pay back the principal and accruing interest. If they don't, their wages can be garnished, credit damaged, and loans turned over to a collection agency.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Loan repayment is a huge and growing problem. One study projects that nearly 40 percent of students who borrowed in the mid-2000s will eventually default.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Income-share agreements look a lot like loans, at first. In both cases, a bank gives students a certain amount of money to pay tuition, fees and other college expenses. Like a loan, it is a legally binding contract that obligates students to make monthly payments until their obligation is fulfilled.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The difference is in the repayment. Loan payments are typically driven by principal and interest. Income-share agreements payments are driven by income and time. Students agree to pay a certain percentage of their earnings for a fixed period. If they make more, they pay more. If they make less, they pay less. Students with high earnings could end up paying back the equivalent of a loan with a high interest rate. Students with meager earnings could pay back less than the original principal.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   In that sense, an income-share agreement is like a loan with a built-in insurance policy. Students forgo some of the potential upside of making a lot of money after graduation in order to eliminate some of the downside of making little or no money instead. Regular federal student loans have a similar provision, allowing students to limit their payments to a percentage of their income.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Income-share agreements are often used by ''coding boot camps,'' private-sector companies ineligible for federal student loans. Boot camps offer short-term training in high-demand skills like software engineering and 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone . At Flatiron School, for example, students can opt to pay 10 percent of their gross income for 48 months after graduating, through such an agreement. If their annualized income falls below $40,000 in a given month, they owe zero -- but that won't count as one of the 48 months. The most they can pay, in total, is 150 percent of Flatiron's upfront tuition fees.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Traditional colleges and universities are also experimenting with this financing, most prominently Purdue. The Purdue program adjusts the payment terms depending on students' academic majors, because some fields are more lucrative than others. A computer science major who graduates next spring with a $10,000 income-share agreement would owe 2.32 percent of income for 88 months, around seven years. A philosophy major would owe 4.01 percent for 116 months, or nearly 10 years. Philosophy majors pay a higher percentage for longer because their expected income is less. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Proponents note that colleges have a financial stake in the success of students whose education is funded this way, something that is not the case with regular student loans. With very few exceptions, it doesn't matter how many of a given college's graduates default on traditional loans. Colleges are paid up front. With income-share agreements, colleges make less if their graduates make less and more if they make more. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Legislation has been introduced in Congress that would solidify the legal standing of the agreements and set limits on their terms. At the financial aid convention this month, Department of Education officials announced an experimental initiative that, if expanded, could eventually increase their use by orders of magnitude. The program would give students the option of converting their regular student loans into income-share agreements. Colleges would pay the federal government back and effectively become the bank, taking on the upside and downside risk. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   With these agreements growing in popularity and political support, potentially affecting millions of college students, it's worth asking what could go wrong.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Many of the current ones have terms that appear to be reasonable, or at least comparable to private education loans. But the first version of a new financial product can be very different from the 10th or 100th -- especially when the goal is to put your best foot forward to get federal approval and federal funds.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The model legislation, sponsored by the Republican senators Todd Young and Marco Rubio and the Democratic senators Mark Warner and Chris Coons, would allow banks and colleges to set terms that are vastly more onerous than what Flatiron, Purdue and others are offering today.  Payments of 7.5 percent of income could last for as long as 30 years, and months where people don't earn enough to owe money wouldn't count as a payment, even though banks could still charge a separate fee. This could effectively extend an income-share agreement for someone's entire working life. Payments as high as 20 percent could last longer than a decade. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Repayment is also more complicated than with a regular student loan, because students have to regularly provide tax returns, payroll stubs or other evidence of how much money they earn. Failure to provide that information in a way that meets the exact terms of the agreement could throw the contract into default, converting it into a debt subject to collections, garnishment and all the rest. In other words, all of the problems the new loan products are supposed to avoid. Of course, the consumer protection provisions of existing student loan programs have troubles of their own. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Purdue markets its income-share agreements as an alternative to private and parent-backed loans. That suggests that students using them will have already taken out the maximum available federal loans, which means they will have to pay a percentage of their income in addition to monthly payments on their regular debts. Although Purdue makes a point of asserting that its income-share agreement is ''not a loan or other debt instrument,'' the practical effect is to remove the ceiling on colleges' ability to be paid by financial products that walk, talk and quack like students loans. The distinction between ''debt'' and ''money you are obligated by force of law to pay'' may have some legal meaning, but will most likely be lost on na\'efve students who have never borrowed money in their lives.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   While Purdue advertises it as a ''potentially less expensive option'' for college financing, the university does not plan to lose money on the program, which means that, by definition, it will not be less expensive for the average student. The private-sector providers also plan to turn a profit, which means students will pay more, on average, than they would have paid upfront.  
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Giving colleges an incentive to enroll students in programs that lead to high-paying jobs may result in more well-designed programs. But it also gives colleges a reason to see people who need more academic support -- or who don't prioritize becoming rich -- as ''subprime children,'' as the author Malcolm Harris put it in a New York Times Op-Ed.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   For some students, income-share agreements may prove as useful as a loan, and possibly less anxiety-producing. But these agreements bring no new money to the challenge of making college affordable. They only shift the payment burden from some students to others. That won't change the fact that nearly all students are paying more for college than ever before.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 ToTok, an Emirati messaging app that has been downloaded to millions of phones, is the latest escalation of a digital arms race.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 WASHINGTON -- It is billed as an easy and secure way to chat by video or text message with friends and family, even in a country that has restricted popular messaging services like WhatsApp and Skype. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   But the service, ToTok, is actually a spying tool, according to American officials familiar with a classified intelligence assessment and a New York Times investigation into the app and its developers. It is used by the government of the United Arab Emirates to try to track every conversation, movement, relationship, appointment, sound and image of those who install it on their phones. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ToTok, introduced only months ago, was downloaded millions of times from the Apple and Google app stores by users throughout the Middle East, Europe, Asia, Africa and North America. While the majority of its users are in the Emirates, ToTok surged to become one of the most downloaded social apps in the United States last week, according to app rankings and App Annie, a research firm.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ToTok amounts to the latest escalation in a digital arms race among wealthy authoritarian governments, interviews with current and former American foreign officials and a forensic investigation showed. The governments are pursuing more effective and convenient methods to spy on foreign adversaries, criminal and terrorist networks, journalists and critics -- efforts that have ensnared people all over the world in their surveillance nets. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Persian Gulf nations like Saudi Arabia, the Emirates and Qatar previously turned to private firms -- including Israeli and American contractors -- to hack rivals and, increasingly, their own citizens. The development of ToTok, experts said, showed that the governments can cut out the intermediary to spy directly on their targets, who voluntarily, if unwittingly, hand over their information. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   A technical analysis and interviews with computer security experts showed that the firm behind ToTok, Breej Holding, is most likely a front company affiliated with DarkMatter, an Abu Dhabi-based cyberintelligence and hacking firm where Emirati intelligence officials, former National Security Agency employees and former Israeli military intelligence operatives work. DarkMatter is under F.B.I. investigation, according to former employees and law enforcement officials, for possible cybercrimes. The American intelligence assessment and the technical analysis also linked ToTok to Pax AI, an Abu Dhabi-based data mining firm that appears to be tied to DarkMatter. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Pax AI's headquarters operate from the same Abu Dhabi building as the Emirates' signals intelligence agency, which until recently was where DarkMatter was based.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The U.A.E. is one of America's closest allies in the Middle East, seen by the Trump administration as a bulwark against Iran and a close counterterrorism partner. Its ruling family promotes the country as an example of a modern, moderate Arab nation, but it has also been at the forefront of using surveillance technology to crack down on internal dissent -- including hacking Western journalists, emptying the banking accounts of critics, and holding human rights activists in prolonged solitary confinement over Facebook posts.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The government blocks specific functions of apps like WhatsApp and Skype, a reality that has made ToTok particularly appealing in the country. Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant, recently promoted ToTok in advertisements. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Spokesmen for the C.I.A. and the Emirati government declined to comment. Calls to a phone number for Breej Holding rang unanswered, and Pax employees did not respond to emails and messages. An F.B.I. spokeswoman said that ''while the F.B.I. does not comment on specific apps, we always want to make sure to make users aware of the potential risks and vulnerabilities that these mechanisms can pose.'' 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   When The Times initially contacted Apple and Google representatives with questions about ToTok's connection to the Emirati government, they said they would investigate. On Thursday, Google removed the app from its Play store after determining ToTok violated unspecified policies. Apple removed ToTok from its App Store on Friday and was still researching the app, a spokesman said. ToTok users who already downloaded the app will still be able to use it until they remove it from their phones. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   It was unclear when American intelligence services first determined that ToTok was a tool of Emirati intelligence, but one person familiar with the assessment said that American officials have warned some allies about its dangers. It is not clear whether American officials have confronted their counterparts in the Emirati government about the app. One digital security expert in the Middle East, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss powerful hacking tools, said that senior Emirati officials told him that ToTok was indeed an app developed to track its users in the Emirates and beyond. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ToTok appears to have been relatively easy to develop, according to a forensic analysis performed for The Times by Patrick Wardle, a former National Security Agency hacker who works as a private security researcher. It appears to be a copy of a Chinese messaging app offering free video calls, YeeCall, slightly customized for English and Arabic audiences.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ToTok is a cleverly designed tool for mass surveillance, according to the technical analysis and interviews, in that it functions much like the myriad other Apple and Android apps that track users' location and contacts.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   On the surface, ToTok tracks users' location by offering an accurate weather forecast. It hunts for new contacts any time a user opens the app, under the pretense that it is helping connect with their friends, much like how Instagram flags Facebook friends. It has access to users' microphones, cameras, calendar and other phone data. Even its name is an apparent play on the popular Chinese app TikTok.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Though billed as ''fast and secure,'' ToTok makes no claim of end-to-end encryption, like WhatsApp, Signal or Skype. The only hint that the app discloses user data is buried in the privacy policy: ''We may share your personal data with group companies.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   So instead of paying hackers to gain access to a target's phone -- the going rate is up to $2.5 million for a hacking tool that can remotely access Android phones, according to recent price lists -- ToTok gave the Emirati government a way to persuade millions of users to hand over their most personal information for free. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''There is a beauty in this approach,'' said Mr. Wardle, now a security researcher at Jamf, a software company. ''You don't need to hack people to spy on them if you can get people to willingly download this app to their phone. By uploading contacts, video chats, location, what more intelligence do you need?''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   In an intelligence-gathering operation, Mr. Wardle said, ToTok would be Phase 1. Much like the National Security Agency's bulk metadata collection program -- which was quietly shut down this year -- ToTok allows intelligence analysts to analyze users' calls and contacts in search of patterns, though its collection is far more invasive. It is unclear whether ToTok allows the Emiratis to record video or audio calls of its users. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Each day, billions of people freely forgo privacy for the convenience of using apps on their phones. The Privacy Project by the Times's Opinion section published an investigation last week revealing how app makers and third parties track the minute-by-minute movements of mobile phone users. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Private companies collected that data for targeted marketing. In ToTok's case -- according to current and former officials and digital crumbs the developers left behind -- much of the information is funneled to intelligence analysts working on behalf of the Emirati state.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   In recent months, semiofficial state publications began promoting ToTok as the free app long sought by Emiratis. This month, users of a messaging service in the Emirates requiring paid subscriptions, Botim, received an alert telling users to switch to ToTok -- which it called a ''free, fast and secure'' messaging app. Accompanying the message was a link to install it. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The marketing seems to have paid off.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   In reviews, Emiratis expressed gratitude to ToTok's developers for finally bringing them a free messaging app. ''Blessings! Your app is the best App so far that has enable me and my family to stay connected!!!'' one wrote. ''Kudos,'' another wrote. ''Finally, an app that works in the UAE!''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ToTok's popularity extended beyond the Emirates. According to recent Google Play rankings, it was among the top 50 free apps in Saudi Arabia, Britain, India, Sweden and other countries. Some analysts said it was particularly popular in the Middle East because -- at least on the surface -- it was unaffiliated with a large, powerful nation.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Though the app is a tool for the Emirati government, the exact relationship between the firms behind it is murky. Pax employees are made up of European, Asian and Emirati data scientists, and the company is run by Andrew Jackson, an Irish data scientist who previously worked at Palantir, a Silicon Valley firm that works with the Pentagon and American spy agencies. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Its affiliate company, DarkMatter, is in effect an arm of the Emirati government. Its operations have included hacking government ministries in Iran, Qatar and Turkey; executives of FIFA, the world soccer organization; journalists and dissidents. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Last month, the Emirati government announced that DarkMatter would combine with two dozen other companies to create a defense conglomerate focused on repelling cyberattacks.

\f2\fs20   The F.B.I. is investigating American employees of DarkMatter for possible cybercrimes, according to people familiar with the investigation. The inquiry intensified after former National Security Agency hackers working for the company grew concerned about its activities and contacted the bureau. Reuters first reported the program they worked on, Project Raven.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 ToTok, an Emirati messaging app that has been downloaded to millions of phones, is the latest escalation of a digital arms race. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 WASHINGTON \'97 It is billed as an easy and secure way to chat by video or text message with friends and family, even in a country that has restricted popular messaging services like WhatsApp and Skype.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 But the service, ToTok, is actually a spying tool, according to American officials familiar with a classified intelligence assessment and a New York Times investigation into the app and its developers. It is used by the government of the 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 United Arab Emirates
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  to try to track every conversation, movement, relationship, appointment, sound and image of those who install it on their phones. 
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 ToTok, introduced only months ago, was downloaded millions of times from the Apple and Google app stores by users throughout the Middle East, Europe, Asia, Africa and North America. While the majority of its users are in the Emirates, ToTok surged to become one of the most downloaded social apps in the United States last week, according to app rankings and App Annie, a research firm.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 ToTok amounts to the latest escalation in a digital arms race among wealthy authoritarian governments, interviews with current and former American foreign officials and a forensic investigation showed. The governments are pursuing more effective and convenient methods to spy on foreign adversaries, criminal and terrorist networks, journalists and critics \'97 efforts that have ensnared people all over the world in their surveillance nets. 
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Persian Gulf nations like Saudi Arabia, the Emirates and Qatar previously 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 turned to private firms
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  \'97 including Israeli and American contractors \'97 to hack rivals and, increasingly, their own citizens. The development of ToTok, experts said, showed that the governments can cut out the intermediary to spy directly on their targets, who voluntarily, if unwittingly, hand over their information. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 A technical analysis and interviews with computer security experts showed that the firm behind ToTok, Breej Holding, is most likely a front company affiliated with DarkMatter, an Abu Dhabi-based cyberintelligence and hacking firm where Emirati intelligence officials, former National Security Agency employees and former Israeli military intelligence operatives work. DarkMatter 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 is under F.B.I. investigation
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , according to former employees and law enforcement officials, for possible cybercrimes. The American intelligence assessment and the technical analysis also linked ToTok to Pax AI, an Abu Dhabi-based data mining firm that appears to be tied to DarkMatter. 
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Pax AI\'92s headquarters operate from the same Abu Dhabi building as the Emirates\'92 signals intelligence agency, which until recently was where DarkMatter was based.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The U.A.E. is one of America\'92s closest allies in the Middle East, seen by the Trump administration as a bulwark against Iran and a close counterterrorism partner. Its ruling family promotes the country as an example of a modern, moderate Arab nation, but it has also been at the forefront of using surveillance technology to crack down on internal dissent \'97 including hacking Western journalists, 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 emptying the banking accounts
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  of critics, and holding human rights activists in 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 prolonged solitary confinement over Facebook posts
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone .
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The government blocks specific functions of apps like WhatsApp and Skype, a reality that has made ToTok particularly appealing in the country. Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant, 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 recently promoted
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  ToTok in advertisements. 
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Spokesmen for the C.I.A. and the Emirati government declined to comment. Calls to a phone number for Breej Holding rang unanswered, and Pax employees did not respond to emails and messages. An F.B.I. spokeswoman said that \'93while the F.B.I. does not comment on specific apps, we always want to make users aware of the potential risks and vulnerabilities that these mechanisms can pose.\'94 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 When The Times initially contacted Apple and Google representatives with questions about ToTok\'92s connection to the Emirati government, they said they would investigate. On Thursday, Google removed the app from its Play store after determining ToTok violated unspecified policies. Apple removed ToTok from its App Store on Friday and was still researching the app, a spokesman said. ToTok users who already downloaded the app will still be able to use it until they remove it from their phones. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It was unclear when American intelligence services first determined that ToTok was a tool of Emirati intelligence, but one person familiar with the assessment said that American officials have warned some allies about its dangers. It is not clear whether American officials have confronted their counterparts in the Emirati government about the app. One digital security expert in the Middle East, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss powerful hacking tools, said that senior Emirati officials told him that ToTok was indeed an app developed to track its users in the Emirates and beyond. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 ToTok appears to have been relatively easy to develop, according to a forensic analysis performed for The Times by Patrick Wardle, a former National Security Agency hacker who works as a private security researcher. It appears to be a copy of a Chinese messaging app offering free video calls, YeeCall, slightly customized for English and Arabic audiences.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20  ToTok is a cleverly designed tool for mass surveillance, according to the technical analysis and interviews, in that it functions much like the myriad other Apple and Android apps that track users\'92 location and contacts.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 On the surface, ToTok tracks users\'92 location by offering an accurate weather forecast. It hunts for new contacts any time a user opens the app, under the pretense that it is helping connect with their friends, much like how Instagram flags Facebook friends. It has access to users\'92 microphones, cameras, calendar and other phone data. Even its name is an apparent play on the popular Chinese app TikTok.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Though billed as \'93fast and secure,\'94 ToTok makes no claim of end-to-end encryption, like WhatsApp, Signal or Skype. The only hint that the app discloses user data is buried in the privacy policy: \'93We may share your personal data with group companies.\'94
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 So instead of paying hackers to gain access to a target\'92s phone \'97 the going rate is up to $2.5 million for a hacking tool that can remotely access Android phones, according to 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 recent price lists
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  \'97 ToTok gave the Emirati government a way to persuade millions of users to hand over their most personal information for free. 
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 \'93There is a beauty in this approach,\'94 said Mr. Wardle, now a security researcher at Jamf, a software company. \'93You don\'92t need to hack people to spy on them if you can get people to willingly download this app to their phone. By uploading contacts, video chats, location, what more intelligence do you need?\'94
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 In an intelligence-gathering operation, Mr. Wardle said, ToTok would be Phase 1. Much like the National Security Agency\'92s bulk metadata collection program \'97 which 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 was quietly shut down this year
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  \'97 ToTok allows intelligence analysts to 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 analyze users\'92 calls and contacts in search of patterns
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , though its collection is far more invasive. It is unclear whether ToTok allows the Emiratis to record video or audio calls of its users. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Each day, billions of people freely forgo privacy for the convenience of using apps on their phones. 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 The Privacy Project
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  by the Times\'92s Opinion section published an investigation last week revealing how app makers and third parties 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 track the minute-by-minute movements
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  of mobile phone users. 
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Private companies collected that data for targeted marketing. In ToTok\'92s case \'97 according to current and former officials and digital crumbs the developers left behind \'97 much of the information is funneled to intelligence analysts working on behalf of the Emirati state.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 In recent months, semiofficial state publications began promoting ToTok as the free app long sought by Emiratis. This month, users of a messaging service in the Emirates requiring paid subscriptions, Botim, 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 received an alert
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  telling users to switch to ToTok \'97 which it called a \'93free, fast and secure\'94 messaging app. Accompanying the message was a link to install it. 
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The marketing seems to have paid off.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In reviews, Emiratis expressed gratitude to ToTok\'92s developers for finally bringing them a free messaging app. \'93Blessings! Your app is the best App so far that has enable me and my family to stay connected!!!\'94 one wrote. \'93Kudos,\'94 another wrote. \'93Finally, an app that works in the UAE!\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 ToTok\'92s popularity extended beyond the Emirates. According to recent Google Play rankings, it was among the top 50 free apps in Saudi Arabia, Britain, India, Sweden and other countries. Some analysts said it was particularly popular in the Middle East because \'97 at least on the surface \'97 it was unaffiliated with a large, powerful nation.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Though the app is a tool for the Emirati government, the exact relationship between the firms behind it is murky. Pax employees are made up of European, Asian and Emirati data scientists, and the company is run by Andrew Jackson, an Irish data scientist who previously worked at Palantir, a Silicon Valley firm that works with the Pentagon and American spy agencies. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Its affiliate company, DarkMatter, is in effect an arm of the Emirati government. Its operations have included hacking government ministries in Iran, Qatar and Turkey; executives of FIFA, the world soccer organization; journalists and dissidents. 
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Last month, the Emirati government announced that 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 DarkMatter would combine with two dozen other companies
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  to create a defense conglomerate focused on repelling cyberattacks.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The F.B.I. is investigating American employees of DarkMatter for possible cybercrimes, according to people familiar with the investigation. The inquiry intensified after former National Security Agency hackers working for the company grew concerned about its activities and contacted the bureau. Reuters 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 first reported
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  the program they worked on, Project Raven. 
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 At Pax, data scientists openly brag about their work on LinkedIn. One who listed his title as \'93
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  team lead\'94 said he had created a \'93message intelligence platform\'94 that reads billions of messages to answer four questions: \'93who you are, what you do, how do you think, and what is your relationship with others.\'94

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Income-share agreements, promoted by Betsy DeVos and Silicon Valley, may wind up merely shifting the payment burden from some students to others. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Q: When is a student loan not a student loan?
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 A: When it\'92s an \'93income-share agreement,\'94 a new financial instrument being promoted by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 With total outstanding student loan balances at $1.6 trillion and rising, politicians are looking for solutions. Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have proposed forgiving much or all existing debt while making public colleges and universities tuition-free. President Trump is 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 said
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  to be searching for his own loan plan.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This month at a national conference of college financial aid administrators, the Department of Education 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 proposed
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  an alternative: income-share agreements, a private-sector financial product that is increasingly popular among education start-ups in Silicon Valley.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The vast majority of regular student loans are issued by the federal government. After graduating, students are obligated to pay back the principal and accruing interest. If they don\'92t, their wages can be garnished, credit damaged, and loans turned over to a collection agency.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Loan repayment is a huge and growing problem. One 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 study
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  projects that nearly 40 percent of students who borrowed in the mid-2000s will eventually default.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Income-share agreements look a lot like loans, at first. In both cases, a bank gives students a certain amount of money to pay tuition, fees and other college expenses. Like a loan, it is a legally binding contract that obligates students to make monthly payments until their obligation is fulfilled.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The difference is in the repayment. Loan payments are typically driven by principal and interest. Income-share agreements payments are driven by income and time. Students agree to pay a certain percentage of their earnings for a fixed period. If they make more, they pay more. If they make less, they pay less. Students with high earnings could end up paying back the equivalent of a loan with a high interest rate. Students with meager earnings could pay back less than the original principal.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In that sense, an income-share agreement is like a loan with a built-in insurance policy. Students forgo some of the potential upside of making a lot of money after graduation in order to eliminate some of the downside of making little or no money instead. Regular federal student loans have a similar provision, allowing students to limit their payments to a percentage of their income.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Income-share agreements are often used by \'93coding boot camps,\'94 private-sector companies ineligible for federal student loans. Boot camps offer short-term training in high-demand skills like software engineering and 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone . At 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Flatiron School,
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  for example, students can opt to pay 10 percent of their gross income for 48 months after graduating, through such an agreement. If their annualized income falls below $40,000 in a given month, they owe zero \'97 but that won\'92t count as one of the 48 months. The most they can pay, in total, is 150 percent of Flatiron\'92s upfront tuition fees.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Traditional colleges and universities are also experimenting with this financing, most prominently Purdue. The Purdue program adjusts the payment terms depending on students\'92 academic majors, because some fields are more lucrative than others. A computer science major who graduates next spring with a $10,000 income-share agreement would owe 2.32 percent of income for 88 months, around seven years. A philosophy major would owe 4.01 percent for 116 months, or nearly 10 years. Philosophy majors pay a higher percentage for longer because their expected income is less.

\f2\fs20 Proponents note that colleges have a financial stake in the success of students whose education is funded this way, something that is not the case with regular student loans. With very few exceptions, it doesn\'92t matter how many of a given college\'92s graduates default on traditional loans. Colleges are paid up front. With income-share agreements, colleges make less if their graduates make less and more if they make more. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Legislation has been introduced in Congress that would solidify the legal standing of the agreements and set limits on their terms. At the financial aid convention this month, Department of Education officials announced an experimental initiative that, if expanded, could eventually increase their use by orders of magnitude. The program would give students the option of converting their regular student loans into income-share agreements. Colleges would pay the federal government back and effectively become the bank, taking on the upside and downside risk. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 With these agreements growing in popularity and political support, potentially affecting millions of college students, it\'92s worth asking what could go wrong.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Many of the current ones have terms that appear to be reasonable, or at least comparable to private education loans. But the first version of a new financial product can be very different from the 10th or 100th \'97 especially when the goal is to put your best foot forward to get federal approval and federal funds.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The model 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 legislation
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , sponsored by the Republican senators Todd Young and Marco Rubio and the Democratic senators Mark Warner and Chris Coons, would allow banks and colleges to set terms that are vastly more onerous than what Flatiron, Purdue and others are offering today.  Payments of 7.5 percent of income could last for as long as 30 years, and months where people don\'92t earn enough to owe money wouldn\'92t count as a payment, even though banks could still charge a separate fee. This could effectively extend an income-share agreement for someone\'92s entire working life. Payments as high as 20 percent could last longer than a decade. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Repayment is also more complicated than with a regular student loan, because students have to regularly provide tax returns, payroll stubs or other evidence of how much money they earn. Failure to provide that information in a way that meets the exact terms of the agreement could throw the contract into default, converting it into a debt subject to collections, garnishment and all the rest. In other words, all of the problems the new loan products are supposed to avoid. Of course, the consumer protection provisions of existing student loan programs have 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 troubles of their own
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone . 
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Purdue markets its income-share agreements as an alternative to private and parent-backed loans. That suggests that students using them will have already taken out the maximum available federal loans, which means they will have to pay a percentage of their income in addition to monthly payments on their regular debts. Although Purdue makes a point of asserting that its income-share agreement is \'93not a loan or other debt instrument,\'94 the practical effect is to remove the ceiling on colleges\'92 ability to be paid by financial products that walk, talk and quack like students loans. The distinction between \'93debt\'94 and \'93money you are obligated by force of law to pay\'94 may have some legal meaning, but will most likely be lost on na\'efve students who have never borrowed money in their lives.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 While Purdue advertises it as a \'93potentially less expensive option\'94 for college financing, the university does not plan to lose money on the program, which means that, by definition, it will not be less expensive for the average student. The private-sector providers also plan to turn a profit, which means students will pay more, on average, than they would have paid upfront.  
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Giving colleges an incentive to enroll students in programs that lead to high-paying jobs may result in more well-designed programs. But it also gives colleges a reason to see people who need more academic support \'97 or who don\'92t prioritize becoming rich \'97 as \'93
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 subprime children
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone ,\'94 as the author Malcolm Harris put it in a New York Times Op-Ed.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 For some students, income-share agreements may prove as useful as a loan, and possibly less anxiety-producing. But these agreements bring no new money to the challenge of making college affordable. They only shift the payment burden from some students to others. That won\'92t change the fact that nearly all students are paying more for college than ever before.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Residents and officials in nearby locales have bristled at visitors from the epicenter of the pandemic, though there is no evidence that the out-of-towners have caused major outbreaks.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 About two weeks ago, New Jersey's governor, Philip D. Murphy, urged residents with second homes not to decamp to the shore. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   When it became clear that his message had not been fully received, the governor took things a step further: He authorized towns and counties to restrict or prohibit rentals at hotels, motels and short-term lodging to stop travelers from transmitting the virus.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''No one should be leaving their primary residences,'' Mr. Murphy said last weekend.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   But many already had.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   As the coronavirus exploded in New York City, leaders and residents of areas that are seasonal refuges and second homes for city dwellers called for outsiders to stay away. They feared that an influx of people could strain resources, from supermarkets to parks, and potentially overwhelm small exurban hospitals.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   That influx of unwanted visitors did not change the virus's path, which has followed a logical pattern of infection, growing outward from the epicenter of New York City.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   It also did not cause an outbreak: Although Suffolk County on Long Island now has the fourth-most confirmed cases among the state's counties, the caseload remains low in the Hamptons.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Yet preliminary data and anecdotal evidence does suggest that fleeing New Yorkers may have hastened the virus's spread.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   At the southern tip of New Jersey in Cape May, a quaint seaside resort filled with picturesque Victorian mansions and bed-and-breakfasts, a 30-year-old man from New York City was identified on March 18 as the county's first confirmed case of the virus.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   In Greene County, N.Y., home to the Catskill Mountains, the first four confirmed coronavirus cases were all people from New York City.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''I don't want to give out a false notion that because we have 31 confirmed that we are somehow dodging this pandemic; we are not,'' said Shaun Groden, the Greene County administrator.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mr. Groden and other county leaders have emphasized how their county has no hospital, even highlighting that fact in an official statement warning New Yorkers and people from Westchester to stay away. He said that about 30 percent of the county's residences are second homes, most of which appear to be occupied now.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''If I was in New York City and I had a place up here, I'd be here,'' he said. ''But I'm not going to come here with some false sense of security that once you get upstate, you'll be taken care of. It's just the opposite.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Throughout the region, the virus seems to be mostly following a logical pattern of infection, growing outward from its epicenter of New York City. But there have also been small bursts of flulike symptoms in areas where New Yorkers have summer homes, like the Adirondacks, the Jersey Shore, the Catskills and the Hamptons.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   In mid-March, the rate of people with flulike symptoms in those areas was about double what would be normal for that time of year, according to data collected by Kinsa, a company that has used internet-connected thermometers to accurately identify coronavirus hot spots before they emerge.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''It might not have emerged yet into deaths or I.C.U. beds being filled,'' said Marynia Kolak, the assistant director for health informatics at the Center for Spatial 
\f0\i\b \ul Data Science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  at University of Chicago, which launched the Covid-19 Atlas to analyze positive diagnoses relative to area population to identify emerging outbreaks.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''But compared to all the other Covid cases in the rest of the country, at a county level, these areas are already flagged as hot spots,'' she added.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Concerned municipalities have tried to stem the flow: Many Jersey towns that hug the Atlantic Ocean have closed their beaches and boardwalks in an effort to keep visitors from the north away. On Long Beach Island, a barrier island about an hour and a half from Manhattan, rentals of less than 21 days have been banned.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''The second-home people think that it's Fourth of July,'' said Joseph Mancini, the mayor of Long Beach Township, N.J., which this week joined several other shore towns in closing its beaches to nearly everyone but residents. ''They're out riding, biking, playing on the beach -- not social distancing.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   In New York's Adirondack mountain region, the Regional Office of Sustainable Tourism has shifted its message to urging visitors to stay away instead of encouraging them to come.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Do we want you to be here? Of course!'' its online fliers read. ''But for now, we hope you are staying healthy and enjoying outdoor opportunities close to home.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   While there has not been a documented case of the coronavirus in the 17 resort communities on Fire Island, the 32 mile-long strip of barrier islands only accessible by boat from Long Island, several mayors have urged visitors not to come. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   But Charles Sherman, the owner of the Davis Park Ferry, which offers access to the island's easternmost tip, went a step further: On March 20, he suspended all trips for his passenger boats, a decision he said he made in conjunction with the Davis Park Association, a homeowners group.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''We are a small community on Fire Island. The fire department is not there, there are no medical people over there,'' Mr. Sherman said. ''It was the prudent thing not to run at all. We are protecting it.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Nevertheless, he said he had watched some people cross from the mainland in private boats.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   And in Cape May, where the 30-year-old man from New York City tested positive at a local health care facility while visiting, year-round residents regularly call the offices of elected leaders to report out-of-state plates, according to a government official familiar with the calls.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Folks from out of state need to understand the critical need to follow stay-at-home orders,'' said State Senator Michael L. Testa Jr., a Republican who represents New Jersey's southernmost district, which cuts across Cape May and Atlantic Counties. ''It's up to them to save their fellow Americans.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The push to keep New Yorkers at their primary residences extends beyond the metropolitan area: Late last month, the governor of Florida, where many New Yorkers have vacation homes, mandated a 14-day quarantine for anyone who had arrived from the New York region in the previous three weeks.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Similar concerns have even cropped up internationally: On Sunday, Scotland's chief medical officer resigned after it emerged that she had violated the country's lockdown rules by visiting her second home by the sea.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The deluge has sent resort towns scrambling to prepare for the virus. Stony Brook Southampton Hospital said it had tripled its number of intensive care beds, to 21, and hired 40 additional nurses, housing them in a local hotel.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Catskill, a village about 35 miles south of Albany, has been training its public works employees to drive ambulances and operate its ladder truck in preparation for a run on services, said Vincent Seeley, the village president.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   On the ground, residents fear the virus has spread beyond the handful of cases that may be officially recorded. In East Hampton, where cases more than doubled over the past week, to 83, Kamal Jackson, a volunteer firefighter, said calls from dispatch of ''FC,'' fever cough -- now often code for potential coronavirus -- have come over his transponder nearly every day for the last three weeks.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''It was imported from somewhere else,'' said Mr. Jackson, 40, who also works for a pool maintenance company and does construction work. ''I don't fault them. They own property; they have a right to be here. But it was definitely brought out here from them.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Leaders from across Suffolk County, on the eastern half of Long Island, sent a letter to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on March 27, asking for official restrictions on travel to the area. The governor said on Sunday that he had not ''heard any local officials raise concerns'' about the need for more travel restrictions and had not yet considered introducing them.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The Shinnecock Indian Nation, a tribe whose leaders signed the letter to the governor and whose 980-acre reservation is at the westernmost edge of the Hamptons, is trying its own tactic: On the edge of Sunrise Highway, the tribe's large electronic billboards scroll President Trump's recent advisory that residents of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut ''refrain from nonessential domestic travel for 14 days.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''It feels like we have been invaded and they are taking advantage of our enclave,'' said Bryan Polite, the chairman of the tribe. ''Those people were selfish, and we have to deal with the ramifications of their actions.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Donald G. McNeil Jr. and Azi Paybarah contributed reporting.

\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  at University of Chicago, which launched the 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Covid-19 Atlas
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  to analyze positive diagnoses relative to area population to identify emerging outbreaks.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 \'93But compared to all the other Covid cases in the rest of the country, at a county level, these areas are already flagged as hot spots,\'94 she added.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Concerned municipalities have tried to stem the flow: Many Jersey towns that hug the Atlantic Ocean have 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 closed their beaches
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  and boardwalks in an effort to keep visitors from the north away. On Long Beach Island, a barrier island about an hour and a half from Manhattan, rentals of 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 less than 21 days
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  have been banned.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93The second-home people think that it\'92s Fourth of July,\'94 said Joseph Mancini, the mayor of Long Beach Township, N.J., which this week joined several other shore towns in 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 closing its beaches
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  to nearly everyone but residents. \'93They\'92re out riding, biking, playing on the beach \'97 not social distancing.\'94
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 In New York\'92s Adirondack mountain region, the Regional Office of Sustainable Tourism has shifted its message to urging visitors to stay away instead of encouraging them to come.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 \'93Do we want you to be here? Of course!\'94 its 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 online fliers
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  read. \'93But for now, we hope you are staying healthy and enjoying outdoor opportunities close to home.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 While there has not been a documented case of the coronavirus in the 17 resort communities on Fire Island, the 32 mile-long strip of barrier islands only accessible by boat from Long Island, several mayors have 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 urged visitors not to come
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone . 
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 But Charles Sherman, the owner of the Davis Park Ferry, which offers access to the island\'92s easternmost tip, went a step further: On March 20, he suspended all trips for his passenger boats, a decision he said he made in conjunction with the Davis Park Association, a homeowners group.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93We are a small community on Fire Island. The fire department is not there, there are no medical people over there,\'94 Mr. Sherman said. \'93It was the prudent thing not to run at all. We are protecting it.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Nevertheless, he said he had watched some people cross from the mainland in private boats.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 And in Cape May, where the 30-year-old man from New York City tested positive at a local health care facility while visiting, year-round residents regularly call the offices of elected leaders to report out-of-state plates, according to a government official familiar with the calls.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93Folks from out of state need to understand the critical need to follow stay-at-home orders,\'94 said State Senator Michael L. Testa Jr., a Republican who represents New Jersey\'92s southernmost district, which cuts across Cape May and Atlantic Counties. \'93It\'92s up to them to save their fellow Americans.\'94
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The push to keep New Yorkers at their primary residences extends beyond the metropolitan area: Late last month, the governor of Florida, where many New Yorkers have vacation homes, 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 mandated a 14-day quarantine
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  for anyone who had arrived from the New York region in the previous three weeks.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Similar concerns have even cropped up internationally: On Sunday, 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Scotland\'92s chief medical officer
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  resigned after it emerged that she had violated the country\'92s lockdown rules by 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 visiting her second home by the sea
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone .
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The deluge has sent resort towns scrambling to prepare for the virus. Stony Brook Southampton Hospital said it had tripled its number of intensive care beds, to 21, and hired 40 additional nurses, housing them in a local hotel.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Catskill, a village about 35 miles south of Albany, has been training its public works employees to drive ambulances and operate its ladder truck in preparation for a run on services, said Vincent Seeley, the village president.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 On the ground, residents fear the virus has spread beyond the handful of cases that may be officially recorded. In East Hampton, where cases more than doubled over the past week, to 83, Kamal Jackson, a volunteer firefighter, said calls from dispatch of \'93FC,\'94 fever cough \'97 now often code for potential coronavirus \'97 have come over his transponder nearly every day for the last three weeks.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93It was imported from somewhere else,\'94 said Mr. Jackson, 40, who also works for a pool maintenance company and does construction work. \'93I don\'92t fault them. They own property; they have a right to be here. But it was definitely brought out here from them.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Leaders from across Suffolk County, on the eastern half of Long Island, sent a letter to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on March 27, asking for official restrictions on travel to the area. The governor said on Sunday that he had not \'93heard any local officials raise concerns\'94 about the need for more travel restrictions and had not yet considered introducing them.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The Shinnecock Indian Nation, a tribe whose leaders signed the letter to the governor and whose 980-acre reservation is at the westernmost edge of the Hamptons, is trying its own tactic: On the edge of Sunrise Highway, the tribe\'92s large 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 electronic billboards

\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 \'93It feels like we have been invaded and they are taking advantage of our enclave,\'94 said Bryan Polite, the chairman of the tribe. \'93Those people were selfish, and we have to deal with the ramifications of their actions.\'94

\f2\fs20 \cf0 This article is part of our latest Artificial Intelligence special report, which focuses on how the technology continues to evolve and affect our lives.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 A couple of decades ago, Jeff Alger, then a senior manager at Microsoft, was coaching state-level soccer teams and realized that there was very little science to player development. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''There were no objective ways of measuring how good players are,'' said Mr. Alger, ''and without being able to measure, you have nothing.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   He said it offended his sense of systems design to recognize a problem but do nothing about it, so he quit his job, got a master's degree in sports management and started a company that would use artificial intelligence to assess athletic talent and training.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   His company, Seattle Sports Sciences, is one of a handful using the pattern-recognizing power of machine learning to revolutionize coaching and make advanced analytics available to teams of all kinds.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The trend is touching professional sports and changing sports medicine. And, perhaps inevitably, it has altered the odds in sports betting.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   John Milton, the architect of Seattle Sports Sciences' artificial intelligence system, spent a week in October with the Spanish soccer team M\'e1laga, which plays in Spain's second division, capturing everything that happened on the pitch with about 20 synchronized cameras in 4K ultra high-definition video.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''It's like omniscience,'' Mr. Milton said. The system, ISOTechne, evaluates a player's skill and consistency and who is passing or receiving with what frequency,  as well as the structure of the team's defense. It even tracks the axis of spin and rate of rotation of the ball.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   That is not the only way that the company's technology is being used. Professional soccer teams derive a growing slice of revenue from selling players. Soccer academies have become profit centers for many teams as they develop talented players and then sell them to other teams. It is now a $7 billion business. But without objective measurements of a player's ability, putting a value on an athlete is difficult.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''It's a matter of whether that player's movements and what they do with the ball correspond to the demands that they will have on your particular team,'' said Mr. Alger, now the president and chief executive of Seattle Sports Sciences. He said, for example, that his company could identify a player who was less skilled at other phases of the game but was better at delivering the ball on a corner kick or a free kick -- a skill that a coach could be looking for.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Some systems can also detect and predict injuries.  Dr. Phil Wagner, chief executive and founder of Sparta Science, works from a warehouse in Silicon Valley that has a running track and is scattered with equipment for assessing athletes' physical condition.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The company uses machine learning to gather data from electronic plates on the ground that measure force and balance. The system gathers 3,000 data points a second and a test -- jumping or balancing -- takes about 20 seconds.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Athletes don't recognize that there's an injury coming or there's an injury that exists,'' Dr. Wagner said, adding that the system has a proven record of diagnosing or predicting injury. ''We're identifying risk and then providing the best recommendation to reduce that risk.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Tyson Ross, a pitcher competing for a roster spot with the San Francisco Giants, has been using Sparta Science's system since he was drafted in 2008. He visits the company's facilities roughly every other week during the off-season to do vertical jumps, sway tests, a single leg balance test and a one-arm plank on the plate, blindfolded.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Based on the data that's collected, it tells me how I'm moving compared to previously and how I'm moving compared to my ideal movement signature, as they call it,'' Mr. Ross said. Sparta Science then tailors his workouts to move him closer to that ideal.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The Pittsburgh Steelers, the Detroit Lions and the Washington Redskins, among others, use the system regularly, Dr. Wagner said. Sparta Science is also used to evaluate college players in the National Football League's annual scouting combine.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Of course, it is inevitable that machine learning's predictive power would be applied to another lucrative end of the sports industry: betting. Sportlogiq, a Montreal-based firm, has a system that primarily relies on broadcast feeds to analyze players and teams in hockey, soccer, football and lacrosse.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mehrsan Javan, the company's chief technology officer and one of its co-founders, said the majority of National Hockey League teams, including the last four Stanley Cup champions, used Sportlogiq's system to evaluate players.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Josh Flynn, assistant general manager for the Columbus Blue Jackets, Ohio's professional hockey franchise, said the team used Sportlogiq to analyze players and strategy. ''We can dive levels deeper into questions we have about the game than we did before,'' Mr. Flynn said. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   But Sportlogiq also sells analytic data to bookmakers in the United States, helping them set odds on bets, and hopes to sell information to individual bettors soon.  Mr. Javan is looking to hire a vice president of betting.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   They key to all of this sports-focused technology is data.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Algorithms come and go, but data is forever,'' Mr. Alger is fond of saying. Computer vision systems have to be told what to look for, whether it be tumors in an X-ray or bicycles on the road. In Seattle Sports Sciences' case, the computers must be trained to recognize the ball in various lighting conditions as well as understand which plane of the foot is striking the ball.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   To do that, teams of workers first have to painstakingly annotate millions of images. The more annotated data, the more accurate the machine-learning analysis will be.  ''Basically, whoever has the most labeled data wins,'' said Mr. Milton, the A.I. architect.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Seattle Sports Sciences uses Labelbox, a training data platform that allows Mr. Milton's 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  team in Seattle to work with shifts of workers in India who label data 24 hours a day. ''That's how fast you have to move to compete in modern vision A.I.,'' Mr. Milton said. ''It's basically a labeling arms race.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Dr. Wagner of Sparta Science agrees, noting that with algorithms readily available and cloud computing power now available everywhere, the differentiator is data. He said it took Sparta Science 10 years to build up enough data to train its machine-learning system adequately.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Sam Robertson, who runs the sports performance and business program at Victoria University in Melbourne, Australia, said it would take time for the technology to transform sports. ''The decision-making component of this right now is still almost exclusively done by humans,'' he said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''We need to work on the quality of the inputs,'' he said, meaning the labeled data. ''That's what's going to improve things.''

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Jenna Blair Kaye-Kauderer and Scott Michael Steinberg are to be married March 29 in Medicine Bow-Routt National Forests in Steamboat Springs, Colo. Halley Kaye-Kauderer, the bride's sister, who is affiliated with Open Ministry, is to officiate. The couple had originally planned to wed at the Champagne Powder Room, an events space at the top of the mountain, before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that events with 50 or more be postponed.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The couple, who are to take the surname Kaye-Steinberg, met at Stanford, from which each received an M.B.A. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Ms. Kaye-Kauderer, 31, works in Manhattan as a senior director responsible for inbound payments for the credit card division at Capital One, a financial institution. She graduated magna cum laude from Brown.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   She is a daughter of Beth S. Kauderer of Manhattan and Andrew J. Kaye of Brooklyn. The bride's father, who is retired, was a corporate lawyer in private practice based in Manhattan. Her mother is a senior associate director in Manhattan at Columbia Technology Ventures at Columbia University, which is now focusing on diagnostic and therapeutic products to fight Covid-19.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Scott Steinberg, 30, is the vice president for product at Enigma Technologies, a Manhattan-based 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  company that builds data for small businesses. He graduated from the University of Michigan.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   He is a son of Susan Sachs Steinberg and Leon Steinberg, both of Minneapolis. The groom's mother is a psychiatric nurse practitioner at the Boynton Health Clinic at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. His father, who is retired, was the managing director of North America in Chicago at Dennemeyer, a Munich-based provider of intellectual property support services. He is now a part-time ski instructor in Steamboat Springs. The groom is a stepson of Dr. Sarah S. Kaplan.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The couple, who both enjoy skiing and other outdoor activities, met in 2015 at Stanford, and became best friends. A year and a half later, they decided to give dating a try. Two weeks before the ceremony, the couple arrived in Steamboat Springs, where the groom's father has a house, and got their marriage license a half-hour before the courthouse shut down. They decided they would hike to a spot in Medicine Bow-Routt National Forests for a ceremony with some immediate family members, who had moved up flights, or drove in from New York. (Originally the couple expected 180 guests with weekend activities including hot springs and an apr\'e8s ski event.)
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''At a time when things seem very dark, this is something for us to look forward to, to bring us and our families a lot of joy,'' the groom said.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 GARDNER--Harold Hepworth, M.D. 1938-2020 Dr. Harold "Hank" Gardner, Physician-entrepre- neur, professor, author and philanthropist, died peacefully at his winter home in Los Angeles. He was 82 years old. Born February 9, 1938 in Grover, Wyoming to educator parents, Lorean and Delos Gardner, he was the fifth of eight children. He attended Star Valley High School where he was an award winning thespian and an all-state football and basketball player. In 1956, he was admitted to the University of Wyoming on both academic and athletic scholarships. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 He played point guard on the Wyoming Cowboys' 1957-58 team, which advanced to the NCAA tournament. At the end of his time at the university, where he was pre-med, he was faced with the decision of following a path in theater, sports or medicine. He often told his friends that, "doctors seemed like the smartest people around. I want to be one of those guys." He was admitted to the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry where he graduated with honors and a degree in medicine in 1965. In 1967, he was drafted by the United States Army and spent a year in Vietnam serving as a medical officer where he was awarded the bronze star. Upon returning home from the army, Dr. Gardner began what would be a long and illustrious career in both medicine and business. His time in Vietnam and Australia, as a Mormon missionary, were both instrumental in helping him formulate his individuated thinking and skills as a leader who was unafraid to question and make changes to a broad range of social and economic issues. Shaped by his experiences, he believed strongly that "It was more important to understand the person with the illness than the illness the person has." Following his post-doctoral work in gastroenterology and internal medicine in 1971, he was a pioneer in the managed care and HMO movement, starting and running the nation's first HMO hospitals in New York and then Detroit, Michigan. He held academic appointments at the University of Rochester, Wayne State University and Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York and in his later years, he was an adjunct professor in the University of Wyoming School of Business and Health. As an innovator in the field of medicine and business, Dr. Gardner found a way to merge 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  and behavioral economics with health-care advocacy for individuals. As a physician-businessman he started and ran several companies including Primary Prevention, Inc., Options & Choices, Inc., and HCMS Group LLC that helped some of the nation's largest corporations manage health care costs while investing in their employees' improved health. A strong advocate of the individual's role and choice in health care decisions, he was on the forefront of looking at health and health care as an essential element of human capital. Through his career, he was dedicated to bringing affordable solutions to the health and health benefits marketplace. He ran his last company, HCMS Group, until he was almost 80. Even as his health failed in the past few years, there wasn't a day that went by where he wasn't working on a solution to the fragmented and dysfunctional health-care system. He was a generous supporter of his alma maters, University of Wyoming and the University of Rochester and he always rooted for and supported his Cowboys' basketball team. Hank was an avid outdoorsman and loved to camp out at Greys River, ski, golf and fly fish. He loved travel and bringing his family together. At one of his final gatherings, he told his six grandchildren, "I have had one hell of an engaging and productive life." Hank is survived by his two daughters and their spouses, Deirdra and Jason DiNapoli, Kimberly and Michael Mulcahy, whom he shared with his former spouse, Mary Gardner; six grandchildren, Olivia DiNapoli, Claire Mulcahy, Henry DiNapoli, Ella Mulcahy, Grace DiNapoli, Camille Mulcahy; his former spouse, Marilyn Fiske, six brothers and sisters, Delworth Gardner, Vivian Jones, Laniel Reasch, Marjorie Bradshaw, Julia Sarvey, Joel Gardner and their spouses, children and great-grandchildren. 1/3

\f2\fs20 \cf0 This article is part of our latest 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Artificial Intelligence special report
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , which focuses on how the technology continues to evolve and affect our lives.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 A couple of decades ago, Jeff Alger, then a senior manager at Microsoft, was coaching state-level soccer teams and realized that there was very little science to player development.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93There were no objective ways of measuring how good players are,\'94 said Mr. Alger, \'93and without being able to measure, you have nothing.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 He said it offended his sense of systems design to recognize a problem but do nothing about it, so he quit his job, got a master\'92s degree in sports management and started a company that would use artificial intelligence to assess athletic talent and training.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 His company, 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Seattle Sports Sciences
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , is one of a handful using the pattern-recognizing power of machine learning to revolutionize coaching and make advanced analytics available to teams of all kinds.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The trend is touching professional sports and changing sports medicine. And, perhaps inevitably, it has altered the odds in sports betting.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 John Milton, the architect of Seattle Sports Sciences\'92 artificial intelligence system, spent a week in October with the Spanish soccer team M\'e1laga, which plays in Spain\'92s second division, capturing everything that happened on the pitch with about 20 synchronized cameras in 4K ultra high-definition video.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 \'93It\'92s like omniscience,\'94 Mr. Milton said. The system, 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 ISOTechne
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , evaluates a player\'92s skill and consistency and who is passing or receiving with what frequency,  as well as the structure of the team\'92s defense. It even tracks the axis of spin and rate of rotation of the ball.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 That is not the only way that the company\'92s technology is being used. Professional soccer teams derive a growing slice of revenue from selling players. Soccer academies have become profit centers for many teams as they develop talented players and then sell them to other teams. It is now a 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 $7 billion business
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone . But without objective measurements of a player\'92s ability, putting a value on an athlete is difficult.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 \'93It\'92s a matter of whether that player\'92s movements and what they do with the ball correspond to the demands that they will have on your particular team,\'94 said Mr. Alger, now the president and chief executive of Seattle Sports Sciences. He said, for example, that his company could identify a player who was less skilled at other phases of the game but was better at delivering the ball on a corner kick or a free kick \'97 a skill that a coach could be looking for.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Some systems can also detect and predict injuries.  Dr. Phil Wagner, chief executive and founder of 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Sparta Science
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , works from a warehouse in Silicon Valley that has a running track and is scattered with equipment for assessing athletes\'92 physical condition.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The company uses machine learning to gather data from electronic plates on the ground that measure force and balance. The system gathers 3,000 data points a second and a test \'97 jumping or balancing \'97 takes about 20 seconds.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93Athletes don\'92t recognize that there\'92s an injury coming or there\'92s an injury that exists,\'94 Dr. Wagner said, adding that the system has a proven record of diagnosing or predicting injury. \'93We\'92re identifying risk and then providing the best recommendation to reduce that risk.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Tyson Ross, a pitcher competing for a roster spot with the San Francisco Giants, has been using Sparta Science\'92s system since he was drafted in 2008. He visits the company\'92s facilities roughly every other week during the off-season to do vertical jumps, sway tests, a single leg balance test and a one-arm plank on the plate, blindfolded.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93Based on the data that\'92s collected, it tells me how I\'92m moving compared to previously and how I\'92m moving compared to my ideal movement signature, as they call it,\'94 Mr. Ross said. Sparta Science then tailors his workouts to move him closer to that ideal.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The Pittsburgh Steelers, the Detroit Lions and the Washington Redskins, among others, use the system regularly, Dr. Wagner said. Sparta Science is also used to evaluate college players in the National Football League\'92s annual scouting combine.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Of course, it is inevitable that machine learning\'92s predictive power would be applied to another lucrative end of the sports industry: betting. Sportlogiq, a Montreal-based firm, has a system that primarily relies on broadcast feeds to analyze players and teams in hockey, soccer, football and lacrosse.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Mehrsan Javan, the company\'92s chief technology officer and one of its co-founders, said the majority of National Hockey League teams, including the last four Stanley Cup champions, used Sportlogiq\'92s system to evaluate players.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Josh Flynn, assistant general manager for the Columbus Blue Jackets, Ohio\'92s professional hockey franchise, said the team used Sportlogiq to analyze players and strategy. \'93We can dive levels deeper into questions we have about the game than we did before,\'94 Mr. Flynn said. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 But Sportlogiq also sells analytic data to bookmakers in the United States, helping them set odds on bets, and hopes to sell information to individual bettors soon.  Mr. Javan is looking to hire a vice president of betting.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 They key to all of this sports-focused technology is data.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93Algorithms come and go, but data is forever,\'94 Mr. Alger is fond of saying. Computer vision systems have to be told what to look for, whether it be tumors in an X-ray or bicycles on the road. In Seattle Sports Sciences\'92 case, the computers must be trained to recognize the ball in various lighting conditions as well as understand which plane of the foot is striking the ball.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 To do that, teams of workers first have to painstakingly annotate millions of images. The more annotated data, the more accurate the machine-learning analysis will be.  \'93Basically, whoever has the most labeled data wins,\'94 said Mr. Milton, the A.I. architect.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Seattle Sports Sciences uses 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Labelbox
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , a training data platform that allows Mr. Milton\'92s 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  team in Seattle to work with shifts of workers in India who label data 24 hours a day. \'93That\'92s how fast you have to move to compete in modern vision A.I.,\'94 Mr. Milton said. \'93It\'92s basically a labeling arms race.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Dr. Wagner of Sparta Science agrees, noting that with algorithms readily available and cloud computing power now available everywhere, the differentiator is data. He said it took Sparta Science 10 years to build up enough data to train its machine-learning system adequately.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f4\i\fs20 \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Sam Robertson
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , who runs the sports performance and business program at Victoria University in Melbourne, Australia, said it would take time for the technology to transform sports. \'93The decision-making component of this right now is still almost exclusively done by humans,\'94 he said.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 \'93We need to work on the quality of the inputs,\'94 he said, meaning the labeled data. \'93That\'92s what\'92s going to improve things.\'94

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Here are some tips for cleaning your area of a plane and keeping healthy on a flight.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 [This article is part of the developing coronavirus coverage, and may be outdated. Go here for the latest on the coronavirus.] 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   When a video of Naomi Campbell cleaning her airplane seat and wearing a mask and gloves was shared online last year, it made the rounds because her behavior seemed exaggerated. (''Clean everything you touch,'' Ms. Campbell said in the video.)
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Major airlines, including Delta Air Lines and American Airlines, say they clean their planes to varying degrees between flights, and that plane cleanliness is a priority. But some travelers, including apparently Ms. Campbell, prefer the comfort of knowing they've also taken measures of their own to sanitize their airplane space.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   There's been increased attention on this in recent weeks, with the unsettling spread of the coronavirus around the world.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''The airplane and airplane seat is a public space, and we know that germs can live on surfaces for a long time, so it doesn't hurt to clean it,'' said Aaron Milstone, associate hospital epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Hospital.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Here are some tips for cleaning your area of a plane and keeping healthy on a flight.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Keep your hands clean and stop touching your face
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Wiping down surfaces on a plane won't hurt, as long as it doesn't give you a false sense of security,'' Andrew Mehle, associate professor of medical microbiology and immunology at the University of Wisconsin Madison, said, stressing that sanitizing your space on a plane should be done in conjunction with washing hands and following other best practices.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Viral particles, the transmission vehicle of the coronavirus, must travel within mucus or saliva, and they must enter through eyes, nose or mouth. While the coronavirus can last on surfaces like tray tables, touch screens, door handles and faucets -- one study found that other coronaviruses, like SARS and MERS stay on metal, glass and plastic for up to nine days -- a disinfectant on a hard surface, or soap while washing your hands, will kill the virus.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   However, most people tend to touch their faces more often than they realize. Doing so after touching a surface where there are droplets from when someone sneezed or coughed can lead to the virus being passed on.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   So first things first: Wash your hands.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''It's just as important to think about where your hands have been and to wash your hands,'' said Dr. Mehle.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds or long enough to sing ''Happy Birthday'' twice, and if that's not possible, then use a generous amount of hand sanitizer.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Choose a window seat
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   A study from Emory University found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window. Researchers studied passengers and crew members on 10 three- to five-hour flights and observed that people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Book a window seat, try not to move during the flight, stay hydrated and keep your hands away from your face,'' said Vicki Stover Hertzberg, a professor at Emory University's School of Nursing and director of the Center for Nursing 
\f0\i\b \ul Data Science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  at Emory, and one of the lead researchers on the study. ''Be vigilant about your hand hygiene.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   READ Cruises and the coronavirus: what passengers need to know
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Disinfect hard surfaces
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, seat back pocket and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down too. Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''It's not bad to wipe down the area around you, but it's worth remembering that the coronavirus is not going to jump off the seat and get into your mouth,'' Dr. Milstone said. ''People should be more careful of touching something dirty then putting their hands on their faces.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Disinfecting wipes typically say on the packaging how long a surface needs to stay wet in order for them to work. That time can range from 30 seconds to a few minutes. In order for the wipes to work, you need to follow those time requirements.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Dr. Hertzberg added that if there's a touch-screen television, you should use a tissue when touching the screen. Using a paper towel or tissue ensures that there's a barrier between a surface that might have droplets and your hands, which will likely make their way to your face.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Someone who has been sick and coughing might have touched the door and the faucet, so use wipes in the bathroom then use paper towels to open the door and to close the faucet then throw those in the trash on the way out,'' said Bernard Camins, the medical director for infection prevention at the Mount Sinai Health System.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 [This article is part of the developing coronavirus coverage, and may be outdated. 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Go here for the latest on the coronavirus
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone .]
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 When a video of Naomi Campbell cleaning her airplane seat and wearing a mask and gloves was shared online last year, it made the rounds because her behavior 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 seemed exaggerated
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone . (\'93Clean everything you touch,\'94 Ms. Campbell said in the video.)
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Major airlines, including Delta Air Lines and American Airlines, say they clean their planes to varying degrees between flights, and that plane cleanliness is a priority. But some travelers, including apparently Ms. Campbell, prefer the comfort of knowing they\'92ve also taken measures of their own to sanitize their airplane space.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 There\'92s been increased attention on this in recent weeks, with the unsettling 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 spread of the coronavirus around the world
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone .
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 \'93The airplane and airplane seat is a public space, and we know that germs can live on surfaces for a long time, so it doesn\'92t hurt to clean it,\'94 said Aaron Milstone, associate hospital epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Hospital.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Here are some tips for cleaning your area of a plane and keeping healthy on a flight.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Keep your hands clean and stop touching your face
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93Wiping down surfaces on a plane won\'92t hurt, as long as it doesn\'92t give you a false sense of security,\'94 Andrew Mehle, associate professor of medical microbiology and immunology at the University of Wisconsin Madison, said, stressing that sanitizing your space on a plane should be done in conjunction with washing hands and following other best practices.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Viral particles, the transmission vehicle of the coronavirus, must travel within mucus or saliva, and they 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 must enter through eyes, nose or mouth
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone . While the coronavirus can last on surfaces like tray tables, touch screens, door handles and faucets \'97 one study found that other coronaviruses, like SARS and MERS stay on metal, glass and plastic for 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 up to nine days
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  \'97 a disinfectant on a hard surface, or soap while washing your hands, will kill the virus.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 However, most people tend to touch their faces more often than they realize. Doing so after touching a surface where there are droplets from when someone sneezed or coughed can lead to the virus being passed on.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 So first things first: Wash your hands.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93It\'92s just as important to think about where your hands have been and to wash your hands,\'94 said Dr. Mehle.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Wash your hands with soap and water 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 for 20 seconds or long enough
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  to sing \'93Happy Birthday\'94 twice, and if that\'92s not possible, then use a generous amount of hand sanitizer.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Choose a window seat
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 A 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 study from Emory University
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  found that during flu season, the safest place to sit on a plane is by a window. Researchers studied passengers and crew members on 10 three- to five-hour flights and observed that people sitting in window seats had less contact with potentially sick people.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 \'93Book a window seat, try not to move during the flight, stay hydrated and keep your hands away from your face,\'94 said Vicki Stover Hertzberg, a professor at Emory University\'92s School of Nursing and director of the Center for Nursing 
\f0\i\b \ul Data Science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  at Emory, and one of the lead researchers on the study. \'93Be vigilant about your hand hygiene.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Disinfect hard surfaces
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 When you get to your seat and your hands are clean, use disinfecting wipes to clean the hard surfaces at your seat like the head and arm rest, the seatbelt buckle, the remote, screen, 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 seat back pocket
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  and the tray table. If the seat is hard and nonporous or leather or pleather, you can wipe that down too. Using wipes on upholstered seats could lead to a wet seat and spreading of germs rather than killing them.
\f3\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 \'93It\'92s not bad to wipe down the area around you, but it\'92s worth remembering that the coronavirus is not going to jump off the seat and get into your mouth,\'94 Dr. Milstone said. \'93People should be more careful of touching something dirty then putting their hands on their faces.\'94
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Disinfecting wipes typically say on the packaging how long a surface needs to stay wet in order for them to work. That time can range from 30 seconds to a few minutes. In order for the wipes to work, you need to follow those time requirements.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Dr. Hertzberg added that if there\'92s a touch-screen television, you should use a tissue when touching the screen. Using a paper towel or tissue ensures that there\'92s a barrier between a surface that might have droplets and your hands, which will likely make their way to your face.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \'93Someone who has been sick and coughing might have touched the door and the faucet, so use wipes in the bathroom then use paper towels to open the door and to close the faucet then throw those in the trash on the way out,\'94 said Bernard Camins, the medical director for infection prevention at the Mount Sinai Health System.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Flo and Clue, two popular period-tracking apps, recently introduced health tools that evaluate a woman's risk for the hormonal imbalance known as polycystic ovary syndrome.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 In September alone, more than 636,000 women completed the Flo health assessments, said the app's developer, Flo Health. The app then recommended that 240,000 of those women, or about 38 percent, ask their doctors about the hormonal disorder. (BioWink, the developer of Clue, declined to provide similar usage statistics.) 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   But what many women who used the Flo and Clue health tools may not have known is that the apps did not conduct high-level clinical studies to determine the accuracy of their health risk assessments or the potential for unintended consequences such as overdiagnosis. As a result, some experts said, the new tools could lead some women to be labeled with a hormonal imbalance they did not have or that may have no significant repercussions for their health.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''You could be making a lot of people concerned they have a problem that they don't know will have absolutely no clinical consequences for them,'' said Dr. Jennifer Doust, a professor of clinical epidemiology at Bond University in Queensland, Australia, who has studied polycystic ovary syndrome, which is known as PCOS.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Flo's and Clue's health assessments are part of a broader shift in digital medicine. Health tracking apps have for years helped people collect and chart data on their heart rates, moods, sleep patterns and menstrual cycles. But now some of these apps are going further by using that data to predict an individual's risk for problems like heart conditions. In other words, they are moving from simply quantifying consumers' health data to medicalizing it.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   While some of the apps' new evaluation tools may be useful and helpful, determining whether they are accurate can be difficult. Of the several hundred thousand health apps available globally in major app stores, most lack high-level evidence on their outcomes, according to a recent study in Nature Digital Medicine. And as long as consumer health apps make vague health promises -- like improved well-being -- and do not claim to diagnose or treat a disease, they are not typically required to submit effectiveness evidence for vetting by the Food and Drug Administration.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''It's certainly become confusing as a consumer if you go onto these app marketplaces and these apps are making claims about helping you learn about mental health, PCOS, heart disease, diabetes,'' said Dr. John Torous, director of the digital psychiatry division at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, one of the authors of the Nature study. ''Do we know this helps or it doesn't help?''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Flo, which has more than 30 million active monthly users, and Clue, with more than 12 million, have good intentions. Their developers each said they had worked with medical experts to develop the assessments and had based them on international medical guidelines for identifying PCOS. The apps also include prominent disclaimers saying that their assessments for PCOS should not be construed as diagnoses.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   But in a recent news release, Flo described its service as a ''digital, pre-diagnostic tool'' to help women ''discover if they have PCOS and also bring peace of mind to others who may suspect they have it.'' Clue said its ''probabilistic statistical model'' for the hormonal imbalance offered a ''smart assessment that can be shared with doctors.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   One woman, a product manager in the San Francisco Bay Area, interviewed by The New York Times who used Flo said it gave her more information about PCOS than her doctor had. But Sasha O'Marra, a copywriter in Toronto who tried a beta version of Flo's health risk feature in July, said she found the assessment irresponsible.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The app said Ms. O'Marra's symptoms -- acne and menstrual cycle changes -- ''may indicate a hormonal imbalance which is probably a manifestation of PCOS.'' She took the company to task on Twitter, explaining that her period had changed because she had just changed birth control pills.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''It's very concerning to me,'' Ms. O'Marra said in an interview. ''Telling people they might have something like PCOS without understanding the context behind their symptoms is a slippery slope.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The company responded on Twitter: ''Here at Flo, we use medically approved algorithms.'' It explained that its algorithm considered multiple factors. ''If some symptoms match, we encourage a user to visit a doctor just to make sure that everything is fine.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   In an email, Flo said the app includes a disclaimer that its PCOS assessment is not designed for women who use long-term birth control methods.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Polycystic ovary syndrome is a prevalent health problem among women of childbearing age. Its symptoms can include elevated testosterone levels, irregular periods and abnormal facial hair growth. The syndrome can make conceiving without fertility treatments more difficult for some women.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The apps' PCOS risk assessment tools are easy to use. They ask women a series of questions about possible symptoms, adapting to certain answers with follow-up questions. After people complete the questionnaires, the apps tell them whether their symptoms seem suggestive of the hormonal imbalance and may recommend they ask their doctors about it.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Professional medical groups disagree over which symptoms are needed to identify the hormonal imbalance -- and whether it is overdiagnosed or underdiagnosed. One 2017 study of about 1,400 women who eventually received a PCOS diagnosis, for instance, reported that about one-third of them consulted at least three physicians before the syndrome was identified.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Women who have been misdiagnosed with PCOS said the experience could be jarring.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''I was really stressed during that time because I really thought maybe I wasn't going to be able to have kids,'' said Sabrina Wisbiski, a human resources coordinator in the Detroit area, who said she was erroneously told by an endocrinologist a few years ago that she had the disorder. She said she later discovered that she had a different hormonal problem set off by intensive bodybuilding.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''I feel like a lot of doctors did not have the right knowledge or experience with women who lose their periods from overtraining and they turned to PCOS as a blanket diagnosis,'' she said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Clue and Flo each said their assessments did not make definitive health judgments. If the apps detect a risk, Flo tells its users that their symptoms ''could be a manifestation of PCOS,'' while Clue tells its users that PCOS is ''a possible cause'' of their irregular periods.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Clue also said it had tested its risk models for the hormonal disorder on nine hypothetical patients who were assigned different symptoms. The prediction models incorrectly detected PCOS in one to two of the virtual patients -- and also typically assigned the virtual test subjects a risk score more than 15 percentage points higher than a physician did.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''We err on the side of caution,'' said Daniel Thomas, Clue's head of 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone . ''Even if we think it's more likely that they don't have PCOS than having PCOS, but it's one of these gray zone cases, we would also still ask them to see the doctor.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Dr. Torous, who has published studies on the evidence supporting health apps, said the validation method could skew Clue's health risk assessments.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''If you're training a model on virtual patients, the model learns how to treat virtual patients,'' he said. ''But a virtual patient is not you or me or a real person.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Flo offered its PCOS assessment tool to all of its users last month, but it has now limited it to women with irregular periods who have logged at least six menstrual cycles on the app. Kamila Staryga, vice president of product at Flo Health, said the system aims to make more women aware of PCOS and help them ''weed out whether a condition is something that they should call the doctor'' about.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   But the Flo app -- unlike Clue -- did not ask about eating disorders or workout routines, factors that could explain irregular periods. Flo said its assessment didn't ask users about them because international medical guidelines for identifying PCOS did not include those criteria. The Flo app also frames certain questions in ways that could tilt women's responses toward the hormonal disorder.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Irregular periods may be a symptom. Do your periods always start in the same timeframe?'' one question on the Flo app said. Another said: ''Plenty of acne in more than six months that usual skincare fails to cure could mean a hormonal imbalance caused by PCOS. Do you experience acne?''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''It's kind of suggesting the answer, isn't it?'' said Dr. Doust of Bond University. ''If you were in any way thinking in your head already, 'Oh, I must have PCOS,' then it's kind of suggesting what you have to say to get that answer.''

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Edward Norton's intense, cerebral presence in a film has always been a fairly reliable indicator that you're going to see something good. In recent years, though, Norton's onscreen performances have become infrequent. He has been acting less and spending more time on various tech-related business ventures. But the balance, for the time being, has swung back toward film, with the impending theatrical release of his long-awaited adaptation of Jonathan Lethem's detective novel ''Motherless Brooklyn,'' which Norton, a three-time Academy Award nominee, wrote, directed and stars in. ''I can exercise the acting impulse at the highest level with a lot of the best people when I want to,'' Norton says. ''But I've got a rich life beyond that too.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Where does acting fit into your life these days? It seems as if it's not the priority it used to be. I love the work when it's good.^1 When something like ''Birdman'' comes along, I'm on MDMA creatively. But the experience of doing these things is not novel anymore. It's also just not real life. I don't want to look back on my life and see the large majority of it colored with me playing pretend instead of actually doing things. That's not to pooh-pooh the work or knock anybody else, but I don't think that actors are better for working more. If you take a Daniel Day-Lewis or Sean Penn, the fact that you see them a lot less means that when they return there's a potency to their acting. There's a point at which any actor starts to become their own pollution. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   What you were saying about how you want to feel about the things you've accomplished in your life -- how does your involvement with a 
\f0\i\b \ul data-science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  company fit in with that?^2 Put it this way: For me, some of it is the appeal of an intellectual puzzle. I am not a data scientist or an engineer, but I think I have a sense of where there are opportunities. That was the appeal of Uber^3 to me early on. I hate the New York taxi system. It's a cartel. It's run by crooks. It abuses drivers and gives horrible service. Ride-sharing comes along and outperforms that corrupt model. There's improvement to civic society through these apps.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   It's no spoiler to say that your version of ''Motherless Brooklyn'' is pretty different from the book.^4 Given how much you've changed, what was it about the book that you were willing to spend years turning it into a movie? The fantastic emotional hook has always remained the heart of it for me. You're inside the tumultuous brain of this guy, Lionel, afflicted with Tourette's syndrome and obsessive-compulsive disorder. But you instantly have this affinity with him, because you know him inside the calm center of his brilliant mind. And there's also a great tradition of films, be it ''Forrest Gump'' or ''Rain Man'' or ''Good Will Hunting'' or ''A Beautiful Mind,'' that create an emotional alignment between the audience and an underdog whom you root for, not despite their affliction but because of it. There's a positivity in that. Especially now when, at a mass-market level, so much of heroism is being defined by this high-fructose corn syrup IV line that's about sitting back and people coming in and saving us. What's more nourishing is when people can identify with the vulnerabilities of a character and get empowerment as the character rises. Also, if you go back and look at ''Forrest Gump,'' it's a more politically toothy film than you remember.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Is it? It is. You think ''lovable idiot who floats through history,'' right? But the history he floats through is a cutting look at the way America tore itself apart. There's all this mordant observation about how badly people treat one another, but Forrest Gump becomes this polestar of kindness.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   It's just funny, because there's no way ''Forrest Gump'' would be made today, let alone be a hit. Can you imagine that pitch? Or the social media reaction? Everybody's got all kinds of opinions. ''Chinatown'' is also a great movie, right? And it's in the noir tradition of looking at what's going on underneath the sunny narrative of American life. But would ''Chinatown'' be made today? If you make ''Fight Club,'' if you make ''Birdman,'' somebody's always going to be lazy and be like, ''I don't have it up for this.'' But they'll do three hours of ''Avengers: Endgame.'' So would ''Forrest Gump'' be made today? Maybe with the right people. Would ''Chinatown''? If you wiped every critic's mental hard drive and put ''Chinatown'' in front of them, they'd take that film apart. Talk about opaque and convoluted. You just drift in the hypnosis of that film, because it's this beautiful rendering of Los Angeles -- great characters keep appearing and unfolding, and Jack Nicholson is magnetic. But that movie is about the unknowability of anything, the impossibility of affecting anything. It's the most cynical movie ever. You're telling me anybody's making that movie today? No way.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Millions of people were watching, say, ''Mad Men'' every week. That show could be considered more than a little opaque and cynical. ''Mad Men'' is cotton candy compared with ''Chinatown.'' I'm not saying it's not interesting, but it's a different beast. ''Chinatown,'' you have to sit and be patient. If you're looking for pacing, if you're looking for plot, those are not the pleasures of that movie. The pleasures are the maturity, the fineness and the obliqueness.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Hearing the way you talk about storytelling and the film business -- even just your use of ''high-fructose corn syrup'' -- makes me wonder if your starring in ''The Incredible Hulk''^5 was bound to involve some friction with Marvel. Well, no. I loved the ''Hulk'' comics. I believed they were very mythic. And what Chris Nolan had done with Batman was going down a path that I aligned with: long, dark and serious. If there was ever a thing that I thought had that in it, it was the Hulk. It's literally the Promethean myth. I laid out a two-film thing: The origin and then the idea of Hulk as the conscious dreamer, the guy who can handle the trip. And they were like, ''That's what we want!'' As it turned out, that wasn't what they wanted. But I had a great time doing it. I got on great with Kevin Feige.^6
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Didn't he put out that statement about you?^7 Yeah, which was cheap. It was brand defensiveness or something. Ultimately they weren't going for long, dark and serious. But it doesn't matter. We had positive discussions about going on with the films, and we looked at the amount of time that would have taken, and I wasn't going to do that. I honestly would have wanted more money than they'd have wanted to pay me. But that's not why I would have wanted to do another ''Hulk'' movie anyway. I went and did all the other things I wanted to do, and what Kevin Feige has done is probably one of the best executions of a business plan in the history of the entertainment industry. As a Disney shareholder, you should be on your feet for what they pulled off.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Marvel may have had a good business plan, but what about its films? I want to like them more than I do. I'm not going to comment on that. I'm saying that Kevin had an idea of a thing that you could do, and it was remarkable. Now it didn't happen to be on a tonal, thematic level what I wanted to spend my time doing. Conflating that into a fight or a judgment is grotesque. Picking fights between other people for clickbait is grotesque. I'm not being hyperbolic. It's part of what's problematic in our country. We are letting ourselves be polluted by fake fights manufactured by other people for other agendas. Whether it's Russians manipulating us into intense arguments with one another over fabricated [expletive] or stupid entertainment journalism trying to get clicks. It's like, I did Bruce Willis's Comedy Central roast, and I made a joke at my expense. I talked about how I tried to do what Bruce did and make a big movie, but I was an idiot, because I tried to make the script better. This is a joke making fun of myself, but they'll turn it into, like, ''Edward takes a dig at Marvel.'' No, I'm taking a dig at myself at a roast. People have to grow up.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   That joke is based on a perception that you can be tough to work with. I'm curious about what that perception means for you in your career. But you're talking about things the roots of which are from 1998 when I and my friend David McKenna developed ''American History X.'' People take things that happen between fervent people who care about the work and who end up shaking hands with each other and they make it into drama.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   I watch everything and I read everything when I research. That perception exists beyond whatever happened with ''American History X.'' You're not reading anything that's any more authentic than people reading a Russian trollbot's story about Hillary Clinton and a pizza parlor is authentic. You're going ''there must be something to this'' just like some guy in the MAGA hat is being engineered by the G.R.U. into feeling antagonistic with liberals. You're wasting your time engaging with the matrix that's trying to foment negativity. The fact that there's a certain credence to it in your mind -- is it possible that there's literally nothing to this?
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   That's what I want to understand. I'm trying to get at what it actually means for someone to have this reputation. Does it mean an actor who pushes back with directors? Does it mean someone who adjusts the screenplays? Honestly, I find the whole line a little boring. You're pulling on a narrative from things when I was 28 years old. That's not even a contemporary meme around me.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Let's move on. I rewatched ''American History X'' and ''Fight Club,'' and it's impossible to see them and not think about how they resonate with the culture today. Have you been surprised at the way those movies' themes have metastasized? Not in the slightest. We've got a real problem in this country with the ripple effects of people feeling thwarted, marginalized, emasculated, neutered, left behind. The irony is that a lot of people have said to me about ''American History X,'' ''Wow, I was fascinated by the almost-Shakespearean idea in it that in a smart person, rage can be a fatal flaw.'' But back then you were able to relegate that rage to jackboots and skinheads and swastikas. Now it's dungarees and button-down shirts. It doesn't even need extremity around it. ''Fight Club'' was coming at things from a more satirical angle, but everything that we're seeing today in terms of an irrational, almost self-defeating willingness of a certain sort of white nativist lower class to find identification in vituperative, celebratory-of-violence assertions is fallout from feeling marginalized. When people feel that they can't get out from under, you get identification with regressive ideas about whose fault that is.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Maybe this question is premised on a category error, but I'll ask it anyway: Is there any commonality between what you think you've learned about human behavior from being an actor and what you've learned about it from data analytics? Does one of these ways of understanding people sit within my brain while I'm doing the other? No. Do working on acting and working on data affirm that people are fascinating? Yes. There are things that people do that signal their intent more credibly than what they say about themselves. And maybe I'm reaching to answer the question in an interesting way, but within that observation is something that's not far off from what really great acting is sometimes. Which is the mining of the paradoxes that exist within people.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   What example comes to mind? People talk about Meryl Streep as one of the greatest actors in film history, which she is. She reveals the facade and what's going on underneath at the same time. There are echoes of that in this bizarrely granular world we live in of incredible amounts of data about people's private actions. What people believe they're doing in private is very different from the ways they express themselves when they know -- or suspect -- that they're being seen.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Nearly a month after his death, Jeffrey Epstein continues to haunt some of America's most prestigious institutions.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 On Saturday, a prominent figure at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology stepped down after the disclosure of his efforts to conceal his financial connections to Mr. Epstein, the disgraced financier who killed himself in a Manhattan jail cell last month while facing federal sex trafficking charges. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Almost immediately, the M.I.T. official, Joichi Ito, left the boards of three other organizations: the MacArthur Foundation, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, and The New York Times Company, where he had been a board member since 2012. He also left a visiting professorship at Harvard.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mr. Ito, the tech evangelist and master networker who led the M.I.T. Media Lab -- a program that prides itself on contrarian thinking -- acknowledged last week that he had received $1.7 million from Mr. Epstein, including $1.2 million for his own outside investment funds.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''After giving the matter a great deal of thought over the past several days and weeks, I think that it is best that I resign as director of the media lab and as a professor and employee of the Institute, effective immediately,'' Mr. Ito wrote in an email on Saturday to M.I.T.'s provost, Martin A. Schmidt.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mr. Ito's resignation came less than a day after an article in The New Yorker described the measures that he and other media lab officials took to conceal its relationship with Mr. Epstein. The internal emails, which a former media lab employee shared with The New York Times, described the handling of donations that Mr. Epstein made and apparently solicited from the rich and powerful over the years, including a $2 million gift from the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   In an email in October 2014 -- six years after Mr. Epstein had pleaded guilty to a sex charge involving a minor in Florida -- Mr. Ito wrote that the gift from Mr. Gates had been ''directed by Jeffrey Epstein.'' A development official at the media lab, Peter Cohen, wrote in a subsequent email, ''For gift recording purposes, we will not be mentioning Jeffrey's name as the impetus for this gift.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   In a statement, a spokesman for Mr. Gates said Mr. Epstein had been introduced to Mr. Gates as a person interested in helping increase philanthropy. ''Although Epstein pursued Bill Gates aggressively, any account of a business partnership or personal relationship between the two is simply not true,'' the statement said. ''And any claim that Epstein directed any programmatic or personal grant making for Bill Gates is completely false.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mr. Gates -- one of the world's richest men and perhaps its most generous philanthropist -- is one of many powerful people to face scrutiny for their connections to Mr. Epstein. President Trump and former President Bill Clinton have been forced to explain their associations with him. So have Britain's Prince Andrew, high-profile scientists and business executives including Leslie Wexner, the chief executive of L Brands, and Leon Black, the founder of Apollo Global Management, one of the world's biggest private equity firms. R. Alexander Acosta, who as a federal prosecutor was involved in the plea agreement with Mr. Epstein in 2008, stepped down as labor secretary after that deal was heavily criticized.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mr. Ito's resignation from M.I.T. was followed in quick succession by announcements from other organizations.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The MacArthur Foundation said reports about his actions, if true, were not in keeping with its values. ''Most importantly, our hearts go out to the girls and women who survived the abuse of Jeffrey Epstein,'' the foundation said in a statement.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   A.G. Sulzberger, the publisher of The Times, and the company's president, Mark Thompson, wrote an email to staff members that Mr. Ito had stepped down, effective immediately. ''Our newsroom will continue its aggressive reporting on Mr. Epstein, investigating both the individuals and the broader systems of power that enabled him for so many years,'' they said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Signe Swenson, who served as a development associate and alumni relations coordinator at the M.I.T. Media Lab from 2014 to 2016, shared the internal emails concerning Mr. Epstein with The Times. She said she had told supervisors several times of her ''disgust'' at Mr. Epstein's involvement.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''That was never listened to,'' Ms. Swenson, who worked under Mr. Cohen, said in an interview on Saturday. Ms. Swenson shared the correspondence after consulting with the organization Whistleblower Aid.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   She said she learned of Mr. Epstein's connection with the media lab when she interviewed for a position in March 2014, and told Mr. Cohen that M.I.T. listed Mr. Epstein as ''disqualified'' as a donor. She said Mr. Cohen replied that Mr. Ito had a relationship with the wealthy financier. In one 2014 email that Ms. Swenson shared, Mr. Ito wrote about a $100,000 donation from Mr. Epstein, asking the development staff members to ''make sure this gets accounted for as anonymous.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mr. Ito took over the Media Lab in 2011 following a rapid ascent in the tech world that made him an unorthodox choice to lead an academic program, but not the freewheeling media lab. He was a two-time college dropout who had run a nightclub, then ran a string of internet companies and invested early in Twitter, Kickstarter and Flickr.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   He was also a master networker -- one who visited the Obama White House to discuss artificial intelligence and became friends with the respected Harvard lawyer Lawrence Lessig after criticizing Mr. Lessig's book when he gave a talk in Japan. Mr. Lessig later put Mr. Ito on the board of Creative Commons, a nonprofit advocate for public intellectual property rights.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mr. Ito's ability to connect with both students and wealthy donors had helped him raise at least $50 million for the Media Lab, a sort of academic skunkworks. It has contributed to the development of technology related to touchscreens and GPS, is home to a program dedicated to democratizing access to outer space and hands out $250,000 awards to those ''challenging the norms, rules or laws that sustain society's injustices.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mr. Ito faced significant criticism from inside the Media Lab. Two scholars said they would leave at the end of the academic year, with one saying he had urged Mr. Ito not to associate with Mr. Epstein. While Mr. Ito did enjoy the support of many within the lab, there were calls for his resignation.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''We have worked literally for years to try to make STEM fields safe and welcoming, attractive fields for women and girls in the face of crushing sexism and gender bias,'' said Kim Holleman, an artist who was a visiting scholar and a research affiliate at the media lab from 2013 through 2017. ''It's humiliating to know that men in these institutions, in 2019, still think so little of women's dignity and safety.''

\f2\fs20   At a meeting on Wednesday night with media lab personnel, Mr. Ito said he had ''screwed up'' by accepting the money, but that he had done so after a review by the university and consultation with his advisers.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   On Saturday, the university's president, L. Rafael Reif, said he had asked M.I.T.'s general counsel to hire an outside law firm to conduct ''an immediate, thorough and independent investigation.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''We are actively assessing how best to improve our policies, processes and procedures to fully reflect M.I.T.'s values and prevent such mistakes in the future,'' he wrote in an email to the university community. ''Our internal review process continues, and what we learn from it will inform the path ahead.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The emails provided by Ms. Swenson outlined the informal role that Mr. Epstein played at the media lab. In the correspondence about the donation from Mr. Gates, Mr. Cohen wrote that Mr. Ito ''did not talk with Bill Gates'' and that the program ''did not solicit this money.'' In another, from May 2014, Mr. Cohen and Mr. Ito discussed Mr. Epstein helping connect the media lab to Mr. Black, the Apollo Global Management founder, who Mr. Epstein had advised on issues including philanthropy.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mr. Cohen wrote that Mr. Black wanted to make a large donation ''in honor of a friend, who wishes to remain anonymous,'' and later asked Mr. Ito to find out from Mr. Epstein whether Mr. Black himself wanted to remain anonymous. One email indicated that Mr. Black had given the media lab a gift of $4 million by wire transfer.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mr. Cohen also asked Mr. Ito whether Mr. Black would like a thank-you note from M.I.T.'s president. Mr. Black's preference would be something ''you or Jeffrey knows best,'' he wrote.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   A spokeswoman for Mr. Black did not comment on Saturday. Mr. Black has sought to distance himself from Mr. Epstein, describing his interactions with him as limited to tax strategy, estate planning and philanthropic advice. He has also said Apollo had never done business with Mr. Epstein.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mr. Cohen, now the director of development for computer and 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  initiatives at Brown University, did not respond to messages seeking comment on Saturday.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The departure of Mr. Ito from the media lab came after he spent days trying to make amends. At Wednesday's meeting, which was organized by professors at the program, he reiterated his apology. He described for the first time the amount of money he had received from Mr. Epstein, and said he had twice traveled to Mr. Epstein's island home in the Caribbean to seek donations. He also told the crowd he had returned one check that Mr. Epstein had sent him earlier this year, after an article in the Miami Herald prompted heavy criticism of Mr. Epstein's plea agreement in Florida in 2008.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   But near the end, one of Mr. Ito's staunchest supporters, Nicholas Negroponte, a founder of the media lab, said he had told Mr. Ito to take the money and would do it again. That prompted Mr. Ito to send an email to Mr. Negroponte in the middle of the night, complaining that he was undercutting his ability to make amends.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The situation worsened with the disclosure of the lab's internal emails. An online petition established in support of Mr. Ito put a disclaimer at the top that it had been set up before news of the emails circulated. A few hours later, Mr. Ito tendered the first of several resignations he offered on Saturday afternoon.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   By Saturday night, the petition site was no longer online.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Erica Lynn Kilbride and Eric Ronald Obenzinger were married Oct. 12 at the Prospect Park Boathouse in Brooklyn. Gabriel Hernandez, a friend of the couple who became a Universal Life minister for the occasion, officiated.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The bride, 32, is a 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  solution principal at Slalom Consulting, a technical and business management consultant in Manhattan. She graduated from the University of Texas at Austin, and received an M.B.A. from the University of Houston. She also holds a master's degree in applied statistics from Columbia. 
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   She is the daughter of Laurie B. Kilbride and Patrick M. Kilbride of Houston. The bride's father was a manager of global offshore installations in Houston for ExxonMobil, for which the bride's mother retired as a regulatory admitting supervisor.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The groom, 34, is a global client lead in Manhattan for Google. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania and is an active member of the alumni community at Friends Seminary in Greenwich Village.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   He is the son of Stefanie Steel of Manhattan and Mark M. Obenzinger of Santa Fe, N.M. The groom's mother, who works in Manhattan, is a director of development at the Visiting Nurse Service of New York. His father, who worked in Manhattan, retired as a senior securities analyst for institutional investors.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The couple met through the dating app Bumble in May 2017.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Through their profiles they came to realize that they had much in common. Beside the fact that her name was Erica and his was Eric, each had red hair, was 6 feet tall and Jewish.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''I told my friends I was going on a date with the male version of myself,'' Ms. Kilbride said.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mr. Obenzinger, a native New Yorker, was living in Manhattan at the time while Ms. Kilbride, who grew up in Houston, was living in Park Slope, Brooklyn, where they met on a first date at Blueprint, a bar near her apartment.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   They ordered a hummus dish, and before it arrived, Ms. Kilbride noticed that Mr. Obenzinger mentioned his grandmother several times during their initial conversation.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''That told me how much he loved her, and how much his family meant to him,'' she said. ''Family means everything to me as well. I consider my father to be my best friend.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Then the hummus arrived.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''Just before we start to eat, Eric pulls a Lactaid out of his pocket, Ms. Kilbride said, laughing. ''At first I was like, 'What's going on here,' but then I realized how comfortable he was to do something like that in front of me, and I felt equally comfortable and said to him, 'Hey, I have ulcerative colitis.'''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   Mr. Obenzinger, who said he found Ms. Kilbride to be ''beautiful and very intelligent,'' left the date ''determined to play it cool, and not text her too soon. ''But by the time my Q train was going over the Manhattan Bridge from Brooklyn back to Manhattan, Erica had already texted me telling me she had a great time.''
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   They were dating steadily within a month, and it wasn't long before Ms. Kilbride knew that she had found the man she was going to marry.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   ''He was very smart, extremely handsome and super considerate,'' she said. ''He's someone who I can be completely myself with, someone who I felt secure enough with to share personal things that I wouldn't have shared with anyone else, which is something I couldn't do in previous relationships."
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   As a homage to the Q train, which delivered each to the other on numerous occasions during their relationship, the couple had 45 of their closest friends and family members storm a Q train on Oct. 11, the day before their wedding, to witness their signing of a wedding Ketubah as the train went over the Manhattan Bridge.
\f3\fs24 \

\f2\fs20   The next stop was Park Slope, and everyone celebrated at the Blueprint, where the couple's story began.

\cf0 Flo and Clue, two popular period-tracking apps, recently introduced health tools that evaluate a woman\'92s risk for the hormonal imbalance known as polycystic ovary syndrome.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 In September alone, more than 636,000 women completed the Flo health assessments, said the app\'92s developer, 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Flo Health
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone . The app then recommended that 240,000 of those women, or about 38 percent, ask their doctors about the hormonal disorder. (BioWink, the developer of       \'a0    
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Clue
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , declined to provide similar usage statistics.)\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 But what many women who used the Flo and Clue health tools may not have known is that the apps did not conduct high-level clinical studies to determine the accuracy of their health risk assessments or the potential for unintended consequences such as overdiagnosis. As a result, some experts said, the new tools could lead some women to be labeled with a hormonal imbalance they did not have or that may have no significant repercussions for their health.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \'93You could be making a lot of people concerned they have a problem that they don\'92t know will have absolutely no clinical consequences for them,\'94 said
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Dr. Jennifer Doust, a professor of clinical epidemiology
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  at Bond University in Queensland, Australia, who has studied       \'a0    
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 polycystic ovary syndrome
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , which is known as PCOS.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Flo\'92s and Clue\'92s health assessments are part of a broader shift in digital medicine. Health tracking apps have for years helped people collect and chart data on their heart rates, moods, sleep patterns and menstrual cycles. But now some of these apps are going further by using that data to predict an individual\'92s risk for problems like heart conditions. In other words, they are moving from simply quantifying consumers\'92 health data to medicalizing it.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 While some of the apps\'92 new evaluation tools may be useful and helpful, determining whether they are accurate can be difficult. Of the several hundred thousand health apps available globally in major app stores, most lack high-level evidence on their outcomes, according to a recent study in 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Nature Digital Medicine
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone . And as long as consumer health apps make vague health promises \'97 like improved well-being \'97 and do not claim to diagnose or treat a disease, they are not typically required to submit effectiveness evidence for vetting by the Food and Drug Administration.\
\'93It\'92s certainly become confusing as a consumer if you go onto these app marketplaces and these apps are making claims about helping you learn about mental health, PCOS, heart disease, diabetes,\'94 said Dr. John Torous, director 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 of the digital psychiatry
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  division at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, one of the authors of the Nature study. \'93Do we know this helps or it doesn\'92t help?\'94\
Flo, which has more than 30 million active monthly users, and Clue, with more than 12 million, have good intentions. Their developers each said they had worked with medical experts to develop the assessments and had based them on 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 international medical guidelines
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  for identifying PCOS. The apps also include prominent disclaimers saying that their assessments for PCOS should not be construed as diagnoses.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 But in a recent news release, Flo described its service as a \'93digital, pre-diagnostic tool\'94 to help women \'93discover if they have PCOS and also bring peace of mind to others who may suspect they have it.\'94 Clue said its \'93probabilistic statistical model\'94 for the hormonal imbalance offered a \'93smart assessment that can be shared with doctors.\'94\
One woman, a product manager in the San Francisco Bay Area, interviewed by The New York Times who used Flo said it gave her more information about PCOS than her doctor had. But Sasha O\'92Marra, a copywriter in Toronto who tried a beta version of Flo\'92s health risk feature in July, said she found the assessment irresponsible.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 The app said Ms. O\'92Marra\'92s symptoms \'97 acne and menstrual cycle changes \'97 \'93may indicate a hormonal imbalance which is probably a manifestation of PCOS.\'94 She 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 took the company to task on Twitter
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone , explaining that her period had changed because she had just changed birth control pills.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \'93It\'92s very concerning to me,\'94 Ms. O\'92Marra said in an interview. \'93Telling people they might have something like PCOS without understanding the context behind their symptoms is a slippery slope.\'94\
The company responded on Twitter: \'93Here at Flo, we use medically approved algorithms.\'94 It explained that its algorithm considered multiple factors. \'93If some symptoms match, we encourage a user to visit a doctor just to make sure that everything is fine.\'94\
In an email, Flo said the app includes a disclaimer that its PCOS assessment is not designed for women who use long-term birth control methods.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0

\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 Polycystic ovary syndrome
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  is a prevalent health problem among women of childbearing age. Its symptoms can include elevated testosterone levels, irregular periods and abnormal facial hair growth. The syndrome can make conceiving without fertility treatments more difficult for some women.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 The apps\'92 PCOS risk assessment tools are easy to use. They ask women a series of questions about possible symptoms, adapting to certain answers with follow-up questions. After people complete the questionnaires, the apps tell them whether their symptoms seem suggestive of the hormonal imbalance and may recommend they ask their doctors about it.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Professional medical groups disagree over which symptoms are needed to identify the hormonal imbalance \'97 and whether it is overdiagnosed or underdiagnosed. One 2017 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 study of about 1,400 women
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  who eventually received a PCOS diagnosis, for instance, reported that about one-third of them consulted at least three physicians before the syndrome was identified.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Women who have been misdiagnosed with PCOS said the experience could be jarring.\
\'93I was really stressed during that time because I really thought maybe I wasn\'92t going to be able to have kids,\'94 said Sabrina Wisbiski, a human resources coordinator in the Detroit area, who said she was erroneously told by an endocrinologist a few years ago that she had the disorder. She said she later discovered that she had a different hormonal problem set off by intensive bodybuilding.\
\'93I feel like a lot of doctors did not have the right knowledge or experience with women who lose their periods from overtraining and they turned to PCOS as a blanket diagnosis,\'94 she said.\
Clue and Flo each said their assessments did not make definitive health judgments. If the apps detect a risk, Flo tells its users that their symptoms \'93could be a manifestation of PCOS,\'94 while Clue tells its users that PCOS is \'93a possible cause\'94 of their irregular periods.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb240\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Clue also said it had tested its risk 
\f4\i \cf2 \ul \ulc2 models for the hormonal
\f2\i0 \cf0 \ulnone  disorder on nine hypothetical patients who were assigned different symptoms. The prediction models incorrectly detected PCOS in one to two of the virtual patients \'97 and also typically assigned the virtual test subjects a risk score more than 15 percentage points higher than a physician did.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \'93We err on the side of caution,\'94 said Daniel Thomas, Clue\'92s head of 
\f0\i\b \ul data science
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone . \'93Even if we think it\'92s more likely that they don\'92t have PCOS than having PCOS, but it\'92s one of these gray zone cases, we would also still ask them to see the doctor.\'94\
Dr. Torous, who has published studies on the evidence supporting health apps, said the validation method could skew Clue\'92s health risk assessments.\
\'93If you\'92re training a model on virtual patients, the model learns how to treat virtual patients,\'94 he said. \'93But a virtual patient is not you or me or a real person.\'94\
Flo offered its PCOS assessment tool to all of its users last month, but it has now limited it to women with irregular periods who have logged at least six menstrual cycles on the app. Kamila Staryga, vice president of product at Flo Health, said the system aims to make more women aware of PCOS and help them \'93weed out whether a condition is something that they should call the doctor\'94 about.\
But the Flo app \'97 unlike Clue \'97 did not ask about eating disorders or workout routines, factors that could explain irregular periods. Flo said its assessment didn\'92t ask users about them because international medical guidelines for identifying PCOS did not include those criteria. The Flo app also frames certain questions in ways that could tilt women\'92s responses toward the hormonal disorder.\
\'93Irregular periods may be a symptom. Do your periods always start in the same timeframe?\'94 one question on the Flo app said. Another said: \'93Plenty of acne in more than six months that usual skincare fails to cure could mean a hormonal imbalance caused by PCOS. Do you experience acne?\'94\
\'93It\'92s kind of suggesting the answer, isn\'92t it?\'94 said Dr. Doust of Bond University. \'93If you were in any way thinking in your head already, \'91Oh, I must have PCOS,\'92 then it\'92s kind of suggesting what you have to say to get that answer.\'94\
